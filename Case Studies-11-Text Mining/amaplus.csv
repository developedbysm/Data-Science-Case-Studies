Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory."

5,SANTHOSH S.,HEATING ISSUE,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I don't why no reviewer is speaking about it. It was heating with a normal usage.
6,ASHANNITA,Claim for Replacement of Oneplus 9R phone...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......"
7,Christhuraj,Lovin it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  After 5 days of usage writing this review.1. Best camera quality for the price2. Snapdragon 870 is doing its best in speed with 120Hz display. - Best3. 65W charger takes only 35 min to charge 100% from 15%. - Best4.  Fluid amoled display is awesome on its smoothness. - best5. Lake blue colour is simply awesome üíôIssues1. Facing very lite heating issue.2. Found a bug and informed OnePlus customer service which is if we turn on call recording on call it indicates opponent also that we are recording call. They told they will correct it in next update. Hope this will be cleared but not sure.I give 95/100 for this mobile.
8,Aditya,Very good budget smartphone form OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price üòÅ.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have."
9,ArcTyag,Honest Review after 4 Days of use.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks"
10,Nethra,"It's not a worthy mobile, it has camera and heating issue for this price it's not good",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus 9r is best of both world that you get from samsung and apple. I would rate full 5 stars for mobile except camera and heating issue. Also, the delivery experience while exchanging mobile turned out to be worst. Hence rating overall 1star for the bad and worst humiliated experience. Now I'm afraid to order again from Amazon."
11,Rahul,Heating problem,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have recieved this new phone yesterday. Since I have started using its been heating all the time, while on charge, playing games etc.. All other things are pretty good."
12,Ramapriya Sriram,Worst phone by one plus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst phone by one plusHeating issues :yesBattery drain : yesPhone hang or crash : twice in a dayPhone needs a restart daily else it will stop working. Once it's restarted all settings changes to default.Dissatisfied, disappointed by one plus"
13,sujith,Dissapointed.. Big No,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.

15,Amal,You won't go wrong choosing OnePlus 9R. A decent choice for 2021.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind."
16,devil,Don't buy it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all, it is hearing every time I use camera and play games. And picture quality is much below average. I previously owned Oneplus7 T and I had to sell that in order to buy this one. It was a wrong decision. The sensor is so bad and whenever I click a photo it is never detailed but only superfluous. I am disappointed."
17,Alok,Battery issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery issues
18,Amit Shanker,One Plus 9R,5.0 out of 5 stars,  From One plus 3Then One Plus 6And Now One Plus 9R...Always Launched and BookedüòéüòéüòéNo issues ever.
19,Lokender Pilaniya,Wonderful phone for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium."
20,Sai Krishna prasad,5G bands,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worrest decision taken by OnePlus not providing 5G network bands in india. Only one 5G band in OnePlus 9R. Before they said we will provide other 5G by update. I want my money back. I will take legal action
21,Badhusha Majeed,GENUINE NOTE FOR ONEPLUS 9 SERIES SEEKERS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!"
22,Trailblazer,Not what I expected from OnePlus.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9."
23,Kuldeep,move from OPT3T to 9R best device (No Heating issue after update) :),5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review (8GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered lake Blue its looking Stunning. love the device.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 870 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. i will add few pictures soon."
24,RK,Facing Network issue ( Mobile Data),1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got a defective phone, it is struggling in moderate to weak network areas. Data Speeds are not even 20kbps. Highly disappointed. As the pic depicts, mobile data error icon can be seen 90% of my day usage. It is very weird. I switched from samsung a50 to OnePlus. it gave me excellent data speeds even in poor network area. I will update my review after one month."
25,Bharti,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Got a defective product and amazon is not ready to exchange it saying please contact manufacturer for warranty.
26,Julian Joy Jacob,"Really Fast Phone, at a Really Great Price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)"
27,Satyawan Mali,Review after 3 weeks of usage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount)."
28,arpan,Value for money üí∞üí∞üí∞,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision."
29,Joy Mukherjee,WORST CAMERA... EVER,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst camera...  even a sub-10k phone will beat this phone in camera segment.I never expected such poor quality camera in a flagship killer brand..... first and last OnePlus phone. Congratulations for losing your customer.
30,Shradha,It's a blunder from OnePlus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound."
31,Seshu,Good phone but unable to use coz of heating issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Heats like hell. Initial set up heats up mobile.. 7nable to hold even after using a back case.. Same with games/camera/video streaming apps. Difficult to hold in hand. Needs an urgent fix.
32,Sharada Dutt Yadav,Heating issue.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I never expected that OnePlus phones will be having heating issue. With my device OnePlus 9R 12GB, I faced this issue and highly disappointed üòû. I even bought OnePlus Buds Z as well and Bluetooth droops very often."
33,Anto,Beast with a cute look,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack."
34,Jag Singh,Not worthy at this price range,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just recieved latest flagship phone but disappointed with quality of product at 39k price tag. It's heating up within use of 30 mints even when it gets charged up completely. Batery draining in short time even with normal use of watsapp, accessing mails. Weirdest things I have noticed that you feel the sound viberation from back side when while calling to someone and it's wrost when you play music. It give you a feel poor quality product."
35,Nithin VS,A worthy upgrade,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone."

37,Prasad,Worst in battery backup,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Extremely worst battery.. battery drain s very quickly.. mobile also average camera
38,TULASIRAM,Heating issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone was getting heat when charging and continuse use for 30m any application not expected this from brand like One plus.
39,Moumita aich,One word !!!! Pathetic ü•∫,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well to start with...I got this phone delivered today..no issue with Amazon Delivery..but but but..I am highly dissapointed with OnePlus 9R ...pathetic is the word to describe..never ever thought that OnePlus so called Flagship phone will perform this bad..I have always been a fan of OnePlus ...I owned 7T Pro earlier that was way better than this scrap in terms of performance , camera quality,  fast charging and mostly that was a complete package flagship... but unfortunately I lost my phone last week and thought of giving a try with 9R ..Coming to 9R with just few hours of use...I can hands down say it's the worst of OnePlus series ..I guess even the Nord is better..No pros guys trust me only cons... Feel like I lost another 40k üò≠üò≠üò≠So called 65W fast charging -- in around 35mins only 25% chargeHeating issue just after 10 min usage - error message popsup while taking photos .. heating issues  - couldn't capture at all..Camera quality -- way below average ....Don't know what else to say... It's pathetic"
40,Devendra Singh,Review after days of extensive use!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after 7 days of extensive usage.¬†‚Ä¢¬†I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros:¬†‚Ä¢¬†Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40¬∞C in a Non AC room.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android.¬†‚Ä¢¬†User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS üòÖ not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used¬†‚Ä¢¬†You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get ü¶ç Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Haptic is best in the price range.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place¬†‚Ä¢¬†Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons:¬†‚Ä¢¬†There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly.¬†‚Ä¢¬†While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingersüíÖü§£üòÖ.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like...¬†‚Ä¢¬†1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion:¬†‚Ä¢¬†If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review."
41,Litton Sinha,No more a 5G phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  After getting to know that OnePlus is not providing any additional 5G bands in future for Indian variants after promising to be fixed by OTA update. I feel like cheated paying 40k for non 5G phone is not at all worth....
42,Avi Wadhwa,The only quality product in this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  You may get phones with better on paper specs at this price, but none have this quality. The build quality is significantly better than the competition. The frame is aluminium with a glass black and premium looking matte finish. Oxygen OS feels simple, practically useful and premium unlike those overwhelmingly bloated skins in Xiaomi, Vivo and Samsung phones. The phone has a great display, much better than the competition. The vibration motors are Iphone quality, not the usual cheap quality vibration motors found in the competitiors. The battery life is much better than advertised. I am able to get 6 hours of playtime on heavy games like COD Mobile on full charge. 65W fast charging is stupendously fast. No heating issues whatsoever even while gaming. Buttery smooth performance in daily usage as well as games. Idle battery time is amazing. The cameras are great but lack in colour calibration. Other competitors offer better cameras. Overall, Oneplus is the only brand offering clean software experience in this range, which is the most important thing in a phone."
43,Kabilan T,Poor camera for this price tag,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is very poor. Poorer than 1+ 8T.It seems need a software update for a better picture quality.Over all user experience between the range of below average to average as the premium feel is missing.As well there are many other bugs that need to be fixed, those bugs are very obvious."
44,Amazon Customer,Shitty 9 series,1.0 out of 5 stars,  None of the features are good and looks really cheap. If you're OnePlus user do not buy this any of the 9 series it's only a trash.Picture quality is very low if you click snap you'll feel like you took a picture from a cheap 3k mobile. Worst phone ever regret the decision to buy this shot.
45,BHARGAV,Faster Phone with faster battery drainage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm shifting from OnePlus 6 so it's not a huge upgrade but neverthless, the phone is amazing. Fast, fluid display and excellent touch response rate. Very handy and lightweight which makes it easy to use while sleeping üòÖüòÖ.A little discomfert I face when I put it on charge that it heats a little more than I expected with 65W charging plus battery drain fast.overall it's a great product with a little downside things which can't be ignored."
46,Sunil Sihag,Average product for 40K+! Avoid it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone turns hot even without playing games,  watching content, or even using camera! Oxygen OS feels a tone-downed version of those available in lower OnePlus devices, with no Oxygen Messenger, Dialer, etc. Also, OnePlus treats you with ads (reminders) for Red Cable membership every time you open settings.Honestly it has no special features or terrific performance that would make it distinct from phones available under 30K."
47,Amaanat,Don't buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Extremely slow and disappointing product. I have been using OnePlus since they launched OnePlus One. And this is by far the worst product I have ever seen for the following reasons1. Display screen blinking again and again2. Burning hot after just two hours of use3. Battery life is pathetic, only lasts 6-7 hours before needing charge again4. Unable to perform multiple functionsI would never recommend this product to anyone. I'm officially not a OnePlus customer after this."
48,Samson Louise,Go for Oneplus 9R. Best in 9 series.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I felt like this oneplus 9R is Best in oneplus 9 series. It's worth of 40k. The 65w warp charger is just amazing that your phone gets charged from15% to 100% in just 38mins. I did not not felt much heating issue. Frequently close the recent apps and clear the cache. If you strain the phone too much it will obviously heats. Camera is fine but not a wow factor. Display is just amazing. Phone runs pretty fast with Snapdragon 870. If you are confused with 9, 9pro and 9R, would definitely recommend 9R because it's worth the penny. 9 and 9pro doesn't make any sence with the hasselblad. Not much different with the cameras. It's seems just a hype. Go for 9R you would save 10k comparing with the other 9 series."
49,Prabhat Dwivedi,Check Call quality issues immediately after purchase,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered product with great hope, but all were dashed when during the call, words went missing on both sides. As a Caller, i was hearing things partially and the same was happening with the call receiver. We both were hearing things not completely as if we were talking like fill in the blanks. I don't know what to call this technically. But this issue happened even after replacement and I had to finally return the product. Now, I use airtel postpaid and this problem never happened even with my old moto G5S plus & doesn't happen till now. Unfortunately, it kept on happening with one plus 9R. So, unfortunately, I had to return & give up on one plus 9R. May be I got just unlucky defective product, but I am moving on."
50,Purna sai,Average,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus have a look on this mobile doesn't meet the expectations. overall mobile performance was good but they have to fix some bugs and front camera has too lag and back camera also average. When comes under display it's really fantastic , battery have best performance and sound quality was very good but it was failed in camera . I think this is not a value for money ."
51,Koushik kasa,Heating issue.  !  A big dropback for all 9 series,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's overheating within 5 minutes and not at all good for its cause of radiation , which so many people lack knowing"
52,Dushyant,Late responding Camera & heating problem,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overheating during charging & app usage... delay in image opening in gallery after clicking photo by camera, need to hold camera in position after clicking photo as its response is late otherwise image will get distorted."
53,Rahul Gupta,Matches expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Switched from One plus 5T.Slight overheating issue but that was the case with 5T as well. I am not a high end gamer but a general user, reading work emails, scrolling social media and playing card games.- The UI is amazing, very smooth as compared to 5T.- Camera is good at this range but not to be compared with phones which have camera as the sole USP.- Battery Backup is quite good with me staying on the phone all the time, it dropped from 100-30% in a day of full usage (and some board and card games)The options I compared before buying it:1. Samsung FE S20: Probably the only switch I could have done, but my experience with 5T helped me stay loyal to One plus.2. IQOO 7: Performance and feature wise, slightly better, lower price too. One plus suits social status and IQOO is a newer brand still building it's reportaire.3 iPhone 11: Old vs new dilemma, iPhone 12 was double the price. Switching after 3 years, I wanted a phone fresh in the market.4 MI XI: MI is for masses and I wouldn't buy a premium phone from this brand."
54,Atul,Heating like anything even after recent update,1.0 out of 5 stars,  All OnePlus 9 models have heating issues.I have updated the system sw to latest but still phone is heating in normal uses and while charging.OnePlus is not doing anything about itPls don't buy..
55,Dr.Abhishek Verma,Amazing phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is an absolute beast... 120Hz refresh rate, gaming performance too smooth at high quality also..a great  handset from oneplus again!..65 watt wrap charger with great charging performance..just take 30 min from 1to üíØ.. battery backup is slightly down compare to others...but it is best budget phoneIn hand feel is another reason to try it!"
56,Srikanth Yerraguntla,I won't recommend this phone to anyone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Though the other reviews say a wonderful phone, I didn't see it so in the 2 weeks I've been using this.The worst part is OnePlus has limited 5G bands support. Only 2 bands, they thought it could be fixed with Software update but it's hardware issue. They can't fix that in this 9 series. I thought of returning it to get S20 FE but missed the return date by a day. I'll not keep this phone for much longer.Not a great battery backup. Less than 10hr on normal usage of calls and apps without wifi or any gaming. The OS actually takes up a lot of battery. The only positive point is 65W warp charger, charges phone in less than 45 mins.Camera is ok but not upto the mark for a 40K phone. 9R doesn't have the fancy camera setup. The selfies are better than the rear camera and even they are not good.Fingerprint reader lags sometimes. Doesn't read the finger unless I press it hard on the screen.It feels like a 6GB ram phone, not an 8GB one. Didn't see much difference from old iPhone 6S. Could do better in almost all aspects."
57,vnayak,Aamazing phone ü•∞,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Guys go for 9r even i was very confused to buy or not to buy but i bought it finallyNO heating issue foundBattery life on an avreage i used for 22 hours after i charged.  I dont play too much games on my phone but even aftr playing i dont. Think so it get drained too fast... ü§î But phone is good üòÑUpdate after using 5 days :-Battery is great ( i usually recharge at night for 40 min and use nxt day )that means i charge only once in a day . it is enough if you dont play too much gamesi dont know y people are complaining reagrding heating issue..? ü§î i found no heating issue from day 1 .Reduce the refrsh rate to 60 hz so your battery dont drain fast. (Battery saver and data saver + point) .hope this helps ;)
58,KilooLooki,Poor poor camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't understand the hype at all. It is fast ..fluid .. but the camera is just so horrendous.  Colours are over saturated. And I've tried to adjust display/ advanced display options thinking it may help with colour reproduction in the photos but nothing helps at all. Depth of field is fine but photos are more than just about depth. Especially under artificial lighting Skin tones appear washed out or reddish and my green mask looks grey.. maybe it can be improved with software updates. But as of now in the camera dept. It sucks so bad. Aside from the camera, the phone works well. Fingerprint reader in quick. And I get good battery life after adjusting a few things in settings  I've not experienced any heating even while charging or even while playing a few games or two during charge."
59,Ram Karlapudi,"OnePlus 9R  better option  than OnePlus 9, if you don't care top-end chipset or the premium camera",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Technically it's a pro model for one plus 8T versionThings I like1) excellent Display with 120hz refresh rate2) Haptic feedback is awesome3)Dual speakers are good4) S/w experience is very fluid5) Avg battery6)Avg cameraIf the price is in b/w 30-35k it will be the best budget phone however if you don't care about hasselblad camera marketing and SD 888 processor from OnePlus 9 ,the alternative choice is OnePlus 9R"
60,Prashant Jha,OP Beast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best smartphone you can purchase under 40k...I researched alot and found out it is way better than iqoo 7 legend and S20fer..In Iqoo you can face after sale service and in S20fe you are getting plastic back, slow charging, low brightness and laggy uiThis is my first time using OnePlus device shifting from Oppo K1, the best thing about this phone is the build quality and oxygen os.... beleive me if you once use oxygen os you can't shift to other UI easily, Oxygen OS can be the single reason to purchase itPros :- Performance beast, no lag at all anywhere- BGMI working great in 60fps, soon it'll get 90fps too- Build quality , it's feels premium in hand- Display, the colors, brightness are awesome and cherry on the cake is the bezels it's almost negligible compared to other devices in this range- Haptic Feedback is of flagship level- Battery backup is decent for 1 day use and 65 watt charger is also a plus point, it charges 0-100% in 40 min- Stereo Speakers is best in this range- Indisplay Fingerprint is lightning fast and especially it's placement is even better than that on 9 proCons :- Bit heavy, maybe because I shifted from 156 gm device to 190gm, but you'll get use to it- Camera is the only weak point, front camera is just average, yes the back camera 48 mp does it's job especially in video recording, it gives the most stable videos compared to any other device in this range... only the picture quality is not that great compared to S20feConclusion : If you are very camera centric user and want IP68 rating, avoid 9r and go with s20fe, else in everything OnePlus just kills S20fe easily and don't go with iqoo 7 legend just for 888 , 870 is almost as par as 888... Thanks for reading do give it a like and have a nice day"
61,sumant bhatia,Old wine in a new bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Have been using op device for almost 5 years now and this phone too is an upgrade to the older op deviceFirst the goodGood screen and color managementSuperfast fingerprint though I liked it more on the back as in my earlier deviceNo heating, good battery lifeOxygen OS latest version is goodCharging is superfastPretty good package for a daily work horseNow the badCamera needs a lot of improvement not worthy of a latest flagship even though it's just a rehashed version of op8No wireless charger5G is a big question markPrice for a rehashed version of an older model is high and more competitive prices are available for competition brands.Discount is offered only with one bank card which is a bummer...at least a couple of choices should be availableColors are very limitedHeadphone jack missingOnePlus has moved from there flagship killer image a d started to become like a regular run of the mill mobile company and if they continue the current pricing strategy, then for me this may be the last op phone...just brought this one because hardware durability has been very good for my earlier devices"
62,Satyam Mishra,Summing Up.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Buy this phone only if you want a OnePlus phone(fanboy/fangirl) or are a fan of Oxygen OS.Other than that,the device is overpriced and the camera quality is very basic and takes the beat from phones available at a lower price.Main issue is only two 5G bands. Also this can't be fixed with OTA updates due to limited hardware(affirmed by OnePlus in an official statement).Processor is the same 865 rebranded with very slight clockspeed increase on a single core.Battery is good,really good.65W charge is one of the best in it's league. A top competitor in battery.Good build quality.Decent speakers(Dolby stereo).Decent haptics.If the cons don't bother you and you just need a premium phone for basic use,then go for it(though this argument doens't make sense since it's waste of money and you can buy a good mid range phones instead).Additional info-Want a gaming phone in the budget in neighborhood of 9R? Buy iQOO 7 Legend instead. A really balanced phone except the FunTouch OS which I ain't fan of. Also don't go for OnePlus 9 as it's useless device(especially the Indian variant). Have money enough to buy a premium flagship,then buy OnePlus 9 Pro 5G.Want a phone with multiple features,flagship performance and balanced,go for Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G(only con is old SoC 865).That's it. Have a good day. Out."
63,Navneet Singh,Nice purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great experience till now.. no heating issue and not much battery drainage.. good battery backup and very good screen on time.. i use phone mainly for gaming.. no lag no heating (c.o.dm, r.o.k, pubg, evil land, Asphalt 9) really happy.."
64,Malay,Heating phone just like hot bag,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery Issue.... Phone is Heating during Charging and During Running Application.Heating in Minimum use1st time purchase but bad impressionAfter two days use battery backup is very low
65,Manal Sabri,Decent performance but hugely overpriced,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Previously I was using a Oneplus 5 which is gem of a phone. Kind of way ahead of its time and very reasonably priced. Compared to that, this phone is only a slight improvement in performance but price difference did not justify the purchase.Pros :1. Speed2. Screen3. Zero bloatware4. Fast charging.5. Decent camera. Not excellent but not bad either.Cons.1. Way way way overpriced for what is inside the box.2. NO water protection rating.3. Only one band of 5g supported. So it is useless of for 5g communication in most of the cases.4. Not at all satisfied with battery life for this price.5. This issue is not an issue for everyone. I a facing problems with native call recording which was working fine in oneplus 5. They should provide their own dialer instead of using android stock version."
66,Anand,My first OnePlus Device and it lived to my expectations,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing this review after using the device for 10 days. This is my first One Plus device and it has met the expectations. I have always been an android favoring person over iOS because the customizing that comes to the table and make the usage of the mobile for lively.Software - 4/5 - Clean OS experience but saw few issues while screen refreshing when the mob is on charging mode. This is very minimal and all of the other options are good.Battery - 4/5 - I am not a gamer and a single charge is lasting me for 1 days with calls, Internet browsing. The Wrap charger is awesome with ful charge in 45-50 minutes. Device heats up during charging at times and this is also small issue.Camera - 4/5 - Not a Camera enthusiastic and the Camera works pretty good for a normal users.Call quality and call connections are pretty good.Audio is pretty good and Video is a treat to the eyes with nice display.Cons - Nothing could I find until now but as everyone says 3.5 MM jack should have been there."
67,Jayaram Naik,Best in class,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I upgraded from my 3 years old Redmi Note 5 pro. And it feels like I'm in a bullet train, the speed I get is just awesome. Wow. Everything is just well balanced. Awesome experience till now. And I had many options like some Redmi and IQOO phones but still I choose ONEPLUS, because you know the reason. Thanks @oneplus_india"
68,samrat,Broken phone received never expected with Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Broken phone receive in this box but my mom use it .and I made replacement Amazon dispatch new mobile but delivery  boy cancelled it .even drive support team told him replace it .but he say we never work form Amazon drive support team he call his frnd or boss and cancel it
69,Rupesh,Flagship killer,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Good phone with metallic panel instead of plastic which is the case with its competitor samsung s20 fe 5g.. battery lasted for 1 1/2 day which is great.. display is awesome so as stereo speakers..also os experience is always great in OnePlus devices.Overall my initial impressions are good
70,Shriyansh Pundora,A decent buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you have a budget of 40000 this is one of the better phone to go for.1.Oxygen OS2.Good built quality3.Good performance4.Good screen5.Very fast charging6.Oneplus brandingThese being a few of the reasons. Even I was confuced after reading a few reviews about the camera and heating issues, but I would say camera is decent and I did not come across any heating issue as such. So I would suggest you to go for it."
71,Rajshree Thakur,Love it üòò,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Ok I love the phone...I know by looking at the reviews you're thinking to not to buy...Same with me.It's been 5 days am using this phone and am in love with this phoneSo smooth and fast charging.And charge stays long throughout the day.Yes there is some heating issue while am charging my phone and it's obvious 65w fast charging thatswhy I guess giving heating only that time.But while using this phone am not getting any heating issue.Camera is fine if you click at day light but not good for night clicks.And also one thing am unable to do the finger print sensor...it's not easyDon't know am unable to do it correctly or what but that issue only am facingOtherwise go for it..üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
72,Abhishek Kumar,Best Value for Money Flagship Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:- Has a great Display- Never Lags or Hangs- Proper fit into the hand, not oversize for 6.55'' screen- Nice Built quality and feels premium- Metal frame in 9R unlike plastic in 9- 65W charger is super fast, went from 22% to 100% under 25minsCons:- Camera Quality for both front and back could have been better, good in outdoor lighting but average in artificial- Battery Drains faster, OxygenOS and display drain the most. In Normal Usage, you can get screen time up to 6.5 hrs and a total time of 15-20 hrs before plugging it into the charger."
73,Rukhsar Sheikh,Best flagship phone everüíØüéâ‚ö°,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have upgraded from realme c2 to this phone one plus 9r... This is my best upgrade alhamdulillah ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíØüéâ..

The Only thing i want is One plus throws an Android 12 update official for one plus 9r as soon as possible üíØüî•..  The design and color of the phone is super sick.. lake blueüòç‚ö°üíØüî• it is a glossy color and gives a premium finish to the phone and it looks classy.. the camera module is also fitted perfectly üî• best phone by one plusüî•üòç Alhamdulillah ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
74,sachin,Justifies the value,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't know what people (who gave less than 3 rating) are complaining so much about. I never faced such issues. It's a total value for money phone. This phone comes from a good brand and gives premium experience. People who are complaining might be having so many expectations or they might have found their old phones better than this. But I'm buying OnePlus for the first time. The phone totally makes sense. People whoever is complaining just suggest a better phone than this at this price range in a good brand. My opinion is this phone doesn't have a great camera. It has a decent one and all other things about this phone are classy. People who want a phone which is VFM at this point of time, just go for this."
75,junaid,4 Star For OnePlus 9R - Black Color - SBI Discount.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is well packed. And delivered to ME on next day, as i stay @ Hyd.Amazon do deliver oders on next day with prime.So now mobile.I purchased this mobile with SBI credit card.And received 2000‚Çπ discount.Before i was madly and badly MI user. I have used redmi note 3-4 and 9pro.. bcoz of software issues of sudden switch off and other bugs. Too many adds. I switched to oneplus.Pros.Size of mobile is quite good.And the weight is awesome as compared to other mobiles.Use too many apps.It doesn't hang at all.Camera is OK.And battery last for a day. 12hrs!Cons.OnePlus says it does full charge in 30min.Which is not true.It took me 50min to fully charge from 15% to 95%And while charging. Mobile gets heated up. At upto 40¬∞ +Rest all is good. :)"
76,ASHOK KUMAR PS,over heat issue and disappointed camera with oneplus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  HI i am normal user, i never use games in mobile but i captured video for 5 mins but mobile getting heat very soon, extreme level otherwise ok and front camera is very poor like other Chinese mobile vivo and oppo. disappointed with oneplus product this time"
77,Aravind,Big screen and lovely display,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  As mentioned by other users, phone is heating up. Also heavy compared to One Plus 5T. Not a sleek phone anyway. If you are a gamer, this one for you..I stand corrected on the heating issue. It is only when the Game mode is used. Else I don't se3 any issues."
78,kanika,Just OK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Heating issue is there definately and noticable too. I reduced the refresh rate from 120 hz to 60hz and I can see improvement heat wise.Battery back up is also just ok, I don't think it can last more than 6 hrs in continuous usage . I bought it today itself , and found it just Ok. I have been using 5T before and it's much better than 9R.Camera of 9R is also just Ok.If u like OnePlus oxygen OS experience and want a mid range phone , go for it, else nothing special about it."
79,Tanuj Gandral,Performance Oriented Phone. Camera is fine but not not superb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Posting this Review after using 9R for one month.Pros1. Build quality is awesome.2. If you are in much gaming this phone will satisfy you with performance and battery optimization.3. If you use it heavily like gaming and social networking site it will give you a single day backup easily.4. As Oxygen is the refined version in all Android O.S, so you definately will get the performance boost.5. Double speakers and dolby atmos is awesome.6. 65 watt wrap charger and it can full charge the phone by approx 20-30 mins.Cons1. Camera can be much optimized. Quality can be improved.2. Only a single band is available of 5g network. Hope we will fall into that band.Rest i am using One Plus mobile for first time and i can definately say i choose a good phone.Just an advice, if you are looking for performance go for it.Rating 4/5."
80,Sunil kumar,Batter backup is bad,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery backup is bad it's getting drained + the phone is also getting heated up . So won't suggest you to buy
81,Victor,Don‚Äôt waste your bucks in this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was using OP7 before, from that experience I feel 9R is one of the worst phone ever.1.Performance- No doubt SD 870 was fast actually it‚Äôs SD 865++. RAM Management is also good. Manages heavy apps and multitasking easily.2.Battery- it has good amount battery but it drains very fast. Have to charge multiple times in a day.3. 5G Bands- Freaking 1 band and they tell it‚Äôs 5G powered. Well Settled OP4. Camera- No words totally waste lens.5. Display- Superb Display Quality with smooth transition. 120HZ but drains battery quickly.6. Speakers- No words to express Dolby Atmos is fantastic super loud. Some times can feel vibration at back of the phone.7. OS- Very clean OS with similar Stock OS experience. But has some bugs in it.Conclusion- The OP 9R is only worth for 27k not more than that. It‚Äôs just a rebadged 8T to be very frank.Also note you can consider ‚ÄúGoogle Pixel 4a‚Äù which is really a good phone compared to this OP. Yeah it has low specs but it‚Äôs really good.Peace!!!!!"
82,ABINASH KHANDUAL,Change the brand name to ONE MINUS. Go for SMSUNG S20FE...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought one plus 9R 12 GB 256 GB variant. After using it for two month, i found it pretty ordinary phone.My previous OP7 6 gb ram is more faster than it. It lags more while using gallery or files. In gallery folder it will take 10-12 second to see the photos in the folder.The camera and video quality is more awful. DJI OSMO action camera can shoot 100 times better pic both day and night. I hvae compared it.You will get 48 mp camera with only 1080 and 4k 30 fps qithout steady mode. And  in 48 mp formqt, the zoom will not work!!!!If you want to buy for camera, then buy samsung S20FE. I also decided to buy S20FE, but could not bcoz it didn't have 256 gb variant."
83,Ajay,It's a typical OnePlus. üëçüèª,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is amazingly blazing fast and smooth.Yes, it heats up when you are going to use this for the FIRST time and that is because there are a lot of background applications running like backup of Google, phone setup, etc but that goes away when backup is done.I really loved this phone truly OnePlus experience of performance and speed. That 120hZ refresh makes the device very smooth.Only downsides I have noticed are:Camera's (they are good but not good in this price range especially the selfie one)Battery drains a lot quicker. It is like if you want something you have to compromise on another, in this case for higher refresh rate you compromise with battery. This will need a refill in the evening when charged in morning, maybe this can be fixed through an update."
84,Naveen K Singh,Very Disapointed first time. Do't Buy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm regular user of OnePlus Mobiles from OnePlus 5T to OnePlus 7. Unfortunatlly due to past experience I again puchased OnePlus 9R, afetr uses after one weak first time i'm very disappinted  due very poor performence of 9 series devices.Cons:1. Heating issue2. Network reception problem.3. Bluetooth connectivity problem during calls, calles intruppted very much, I used 3 bluetooth devices for comformation.4. Flikring in display sometime found like oneplus 8 series.5. Fingerprint reader lag issue sometime.6. Built quality not like previous oneplus series. feels like 15k to 20k device quality. Realme 7X Pro better than Oneplus 9R.7. At last I felt very much cheated after no more 5G Band announcement for Indian versions of 9 series, not expected from oneplus for Indian Buyers only, they treated Indian buyers like poor people.At last I advise please don't buy like me, otherwise you feel Bad. I tried to return but there is only replacement policy for this product, no refund. Now I Shifted to my old favorate SAMSUNG Galaxy Series.Pros:Only Show-off that i'm a Oneplus user. Now it is not a prememum mobile."

87,Rohith Hallur,Pathetic camera quality not worth the money paid,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It looks like one plus started looting people with initial quality and now the same kind of gimmicks and stunts by decreasing quality and increasing price.Felt disappointed after buying this phone. Can not even return. Such a bad experience from one plus was not expected :(
88,arpit p.,Most worst n waste camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Most worst camera. Oneplus fooled people by giving this very ordinary camera. Battery life is also ok. Its just working mobile with worst camera.
89,Soumalya Datta,Immensely Satisfied!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The best experience you can get at this price range. OxygenOS has no equal, worth to spend a bit more for it. Redmi/Realme phones can be better value, but none comes close to the experience that OnePlus provides."
90,Anil Kumar Devarapu,Worst speakers and display quality is bad,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst screen quality. Music play back experience is worst on this phone speakers. Sound is loud without quality in it just like listening to someone's caller tune on loud speaker. Not worthy except fast changing.Display quality is really bad compred to my previous samsung Note 10 device.

92,Tanush W.,9R- Carbon Black,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Carbon black, has an amazing premium feel. No heating issues, battery lasts almost the entire day, but I have not played any heavy games on the device so far however, regular calls, continuous data, small games, music, bluetooth is what my current usage is. Charging is super fast!120 hz smoothness is epic. Great display and feel to the phoneOverall happy with the purchase!Recommended, as it is the best phone in the price range."
93,Amazon Customer,"Oneplus 9R, things that really matter, should you buy it?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best performing phone in the market right now, 120hz really makes a difference and i can see the difference between 90hz and 120hz so yeah you need it for future proof. Camera, well camera works fine, not the best in class, gcam port gives you night mode in the front camera which you don't get in the stock app. If camera is not your main priority go for this or 8T, which ever you find at best deal, there's hardly any difference. In 8T you get covers and accessories comparatively easily. I got 9R with exchange and other offers at a very attractive price. Also i could have gone for iqoo 7 legend but stock android was my top priority which got me into taking 9R, if that is os skin doesn't bother you i would suggest you to go for IQOO 7, that is a better option with better camera and better price. Hope this helps, Happy Shopping"
94,Anshuman B.,Perhaps the best phone under 40K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Premium Aluminium frame and glass back120Hz screenFlaghship level performanceGreat for gamingGreat cameras for the segmentWarp charge 65Cons:Minor heating issuesI have been using this phone for more than two weeks now. Very happy with the purchase, however, Amazon did take a bit longer to deliver this considering other Prime deliveries. My gaming is casual, but I did not notice major battery drain or heating during my usual 90 mins or so of daily PubG at UltraHD and ultra frame rate. The cameras are great, but color representation could have been more acurate compared to flagships. Low light images are great as well. The selfie camera isnt 'amazing' but is sharp and reprodues colors well. OIS works great. The phone feels really premium, and everyday usage is a breeze with apps opening and instaling snappily. The touch sampling is amazing. Battery backup is considerably good considering that I have had the screen at 120Hz since the day I got the phone. Warp charge 65 is a great aid. I have noticed minor heating, but the aluminium frame at the top edge gets considerably hotter than the back with intense gaming. Highly recommended purchase. I havent used the OnePlus 9, but most tech reviews I consulted were speculative about if it is worth investing 10K more on the 9 instead. Lake blue is really beautiful!"

  ¬†First time buying one plus,my overall experience is good with the ph after using 4 days.Display: 5/5Performance:5/5 (with oxygen os)Camera: 3.5/5Gaming:4.5/5Sound:5/5(Dolby op)First coming about display 120hz amoled display is great. Next the oxygen os which i liked most. Stock ui is rare now a days and oxygen os is kind of customisable stock ui. I don't think except ios no ui is better than oxygen os. No bloatware,no ads which gives very good user experience. Performance is also awesome, i hear a lot about heating issues but it's fixed almost 50%. after the update and ph heat is general problem. Even iph also heat. U can play pubg hdr+extreme. I prefer smooth+extreme for best fps nd less heat. The one thing i don't like is camera. I mean camera is very decent,even iq 7 camera is very good than this which also costs 10k less. One plus should look out this matter. At last i say if ur main priority is camera then go with other brand otherwise it worths every penny."
96,Smita  Rout,Recommended,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall an amazing phone and highly recommended120Hz refresh rate is very smooth, feels great to use.The processor is really fast, I changed from a samsung galaxy J8 phone and I can feel the differenceCharging is fast, took 30-35 mins to charge fully.I haven't faced any heating issues so far.Camera is decent."
97,SJT,OnePlus is so good not for no reason.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is as you would expect from OnePlus.Fast, smooth, clean, in short, amazing.The heating issue that the phone had at launch is now almost gone through OTA update.It is though a bummer that the phone has just one 5G band and OnePlus has now confirmed that they won't increase 5G bands on the phone through OTA updates due to hardware limitations. So users wanting to have a phone with good amount of 5G bands, I suggest you look elsewhere.All in all, a great experience from OnePlus.Cons: Average camera, one 5G band, only 2 years of updates."
98,SUSHIL Srivastava,Good one,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Good one
99,Prashanth C,TERRIFIC DEVICE!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall I am writing this phone review after using it for about 3weeks!! I must tell this is a terrific device with 120Hz refresh rate. It is pretty fast and has got powerfull processor. The main advantage of OnePlus nowdays is the ""OXYGEN OS"". THE PERFECT, CLEAN AND NO AD OS out of the box. Nothing is perfect and yes even this device it's not perfect but ideal device! It's the best device for day-to-day usage. People have been complaining about the camera in the previous reviews but I believe there was nothing so bad as stated in the review. This phone has got a decent camera but it works pretty fine and it's perfect at it's view. I haven't seen any heating issue so far. Yes while using camera the device gets little warm at the back but it looks down immediately after the application is closed. And the WARP charger is a master piece. I don't have to wait for my phone to get 100% charged for a long it as it charged up in 30mins. It fast, flawless and convenient smartphone. Coming to the 5G thing, as OnePlus claims this device is 5G ready, but giving just 5G and claiming the phone is 5G is a complete disappointmrnt according to my point of view. Keeping these aside the device is an all-rounder overall you can go with the device no problem! I am satisfied! üåà"
100,Rajesh,NICE PERFORMANCE SO FAR...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is working well so far and smooth performance,  but delivery associate was not good and he even refused to deliver the phone at our doorstep. what a Pathetic and arrogant attitude. so one star reduced..."
101,Randeep S.,It's good! Don't understand the negative reveiws,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Been using this phone for around 4 days now and I find it really good. I saw comments on this being overheated, but I didn't face any such issue. Ofcourse, when you're setting up your phone a lot of things happen in the background. Your apps are being downloaded, the phone updates are downloaded and in this case the phone will get a little bit warm. Which is completely normal in my opinion. Also heard a lot of negative reveiws about camera. Now I am not a person who'll look at intricate details in images and compare it to the iPhones and Samasung Galaxy S series. Obviously, it's not the best, but does the job. If camera is your main factor of buying a phone then you can look elsewhere. Otherwise, this phone is good value.Overall, so far so good for meDisplay : 5/5Sound : 4/5Camera : 4/5Responsiveness : 5/5Battery life : 5/5Speed : 5/5"
102,Sachin Yadav,Worst phone for pubg,1.0 out of 5 stars,  1. This phone is not optimised with pubg at all.2. This phone's gyro is working opposite sometimes.3. Worst phone for pubg or may be sd 870 is not optimised for pubg hoping for fix.
103,Nagendra Prabhu,A remarkable Phone - One Plus 9R- 12GB RAM with 256GB ROM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  During Unboxing-To be honest the first impression about the 9R was totally on the Opposite side except for the design side.During the initial setup, I never experienced such a thriller as the phone was getting warmer by every minute. Thanks to the Oxygen OS update 11.2.3.3 which made a huge difference on the same day of unboxing.Seriously, The phone reached a peak temperature when the new update was getting downloaded and installed and during charging as well (Seriously, At some point, I had to leave the phone for a safer distance... funny but TRUE).Thanks to the 1+ teams effort to solve the ""UnUsual"" heating issue.Now after Two weeks of usage and even after many heavy usages the phone never got warmer so i think this will continue (fingers crossed).Pros :1. Display - 120Hz - Now I am damn sure that I can never go back to the lower refresh rates screen phones. The phone's display is silky/Buttery smooth (Take whichever you like). The adaptive / Dynamic refresh rate option is a good one that actually saves battery by optimising it based on the usage.2. Camera- Never had a complaint so far. Got a lot of options especially in PRO mode. The end result of a photo (Quad of Selfi) can directly relate to the amount of light that the camera sensor gets when you press the shutter.3. Performance - 870 chipset is really good. No problem so far and it is highly efficient in managing the RAM especially when playing Games.4. Oxygen OS - Got released (First 1+ phone for me) when started using this phone OS as it is free from Ads and other Bloatware especially the installed/suggested Apps.5. Charging- Charging experience is named perfectly as ""WARP CHARGING"" really good option to have and it fills the battery from 0 to 100 well under 45 mins. No heat observed during charging.6. Battery - So far so good 1.5 to 2 days of battery life between charging with moderate usage( 5 to 6 hours of screen usage). For me, this device didn't die within 1 day. I don't mind if the phone runs out of charge by end of the day as it has Warp Charging a must for all the devices.7. Haptic motor-Very good touch and feel when the motor vibrates feels premium.Con:1. Pricing - Price could have been much more competitive at the end of the day not only the corporate should feel good about profit but majorly the end customers should feel good about the purchase.Finally, as a one-liner I can say, An all-rounder device packed with all the Essentials/Expected points for this present trend but if you can afford it."
104,Ashish R.,"Don't purchase,go for other brand flagship",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Design is good look awesome but I do feel the same heating issue while playing games like COD MOBILE,heat during working with the hotspot.camera is decent but not exceptional.and one more thing the battery is draining too fast.I hope it will fix in future updates.overall I am not satisfied from this product.This is the first one plus mobile that I bought in my life.i am disappointed.this is not excepted from 40k phone."
105,Shiva Prasad,Really disappointed with OnePlus.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been a OnePlus 5T user from more than 3years. I liked it very much and OnePlus used to be the best value for money phones. that's reason I have ordered OnePlus agian though the price is high for the phone with competetors. But really disappointed with OnePlus 9R now, the phone is getting heat, hang and screen not working I have tried basic trouble shooting but isn't helpful. I think this is the worst phone from OnePlus. Lost trust in OnePlus Phones and not realiable as earlier and have become expensive too."
106,Parthasarathy,I want a replacement or exchange. Not at all satisfied about this product. . Regret for buying this.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Unable to install Chrome for browsing. Not advisable to purchase this model. Also mobile gets hanged when we take screenshot. Totally not worth a single penny for this model.Also there are several glitches which constantly occur while usage. This prevents smooth usage of the phone and is very annoying
107,REVANTH LANKA,completely satisfied,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have read a lot of comments on phone heating issues and hesitated to buy this device, but i have been using this from 3 days, i havent seen it getting heated.i guess the complete credit goes to the update provided.phone is very smooth and great to use.pros:1) fluid amoled display is very good.2) UI - this is the best part in oneplus phones.3) battery life.4) 65w charging - in 25-30 mins 100% charge which will last for more than 24 hours in standby and for 8-10 hours of screen time.5) SD 870 chip is simply doing its best in speed even with the 120hz display which is very very smooth and great.cons:1) camera can be better for this price range.2) fingerprint is sometimes a bit delay. (not much delay but we can feel it)totally its a worth buying mobile."

109,jaganath,STAY AWAY FROM ONE PLUS,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Hi i had recently upgraded my phone from OP 6T to this not because my 6T got old because it had so many touch screen issues like ghost touch and unintentional edge screen touch especially during gaming and i thought maybe the 9r won't have these touch screen issues but guess what from day 1 I'm regretting buying this phone It has good battery lie like every new phone alsoIF YOUR MAIN PURPOSE IS NOT GAMIN THIS PHONE IS FINE BUT I YOU ARE A GAMER STAY AWAY FROM ONE LUS PRODUCTS
110,Donna,Worth 30k at most,3.0 out of 5 stars,  My problem with this phone is its not worth the price. Battery doesn't stay even a full day. Camera is just OK that we can find in 25k phones. I just expected more for my money.Edit 1 - My sister uses this phone and she says the battery lasts just fine. Also she loves the camera so increasing the rating to 3 üòå
111,Claret,Nice phone OnePlus 9R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice phone after using for 2 weeks. No much heating issues like the propoganda seen all over reviewes. I was using Realme 7 pro which was 20K. Good phone, good software but lacked performance and accuracy of sensors for wfh office use like parallely using zoom calls, bluetooth conference speaker integrated, oulook mail and chat softwares running. So I thought I would buy a powerful one and got OnePlus 9R. Good phone, performance and fulils what I want. I like the slider very much. Very handy. Camera is fine for me. Missed the 3.5 mm jack as these bluetooth buds shape don't fit my ear ergonomics. But did I find much change for the 20K I was using against this 40K phone? Not much. Also battery drains in a day wheras the 20K Realme battery was running for a day and half and I am not a game user at all. I thought if I had bought a 30K Realme phone with 870+ processor, think it would have given me what i want and saved a 10K. But no regrets. Nice phone"
112,Dileep K.,Low volume and network related issue..,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone volume is very low, at the time of receiving a call volume is very low and it have a connection issues to, iam using Jio sim in first slot, but I have faced an issue many people saying that number is saying not reachable, some times my call is automatically disconnected these are the major issues I have facing, I feel it is not worthy ..."
113,AfzK,Okayish.. nothing amazing,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my fourth Oneplus device after One, 3T & 6 and I am not very much impressed with this one tbh. All other devices brought super value to the table but this one seems lacking in Camera and new features.Camera as in.. obviously it sucks and as far as features concerned my Oneplus 6 has all the same things and tbh feels faster because to show the impact of 120hz screen 9R scrolling slowed down a little on the other hand 6 scrolling is not as smooth as 9R but its faster..I don't need to know whats been scrolling coz I can't read while scrolling and had to stop to see what going on...so 120 hz doesn't matter. Fingerprint scanner sucks..its feels super slow as compared to 6.So overall I would say if you don't care for Oxygen OS and Alert slider then go for something else..as I stick to this only because of these two reasons."
114,sayantan samanta,READ MY REVIEW,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't know why many of people's review heating issues, but yeah it's heat up so fast especially while taking photos. I'm a OP7 user just shifted to OP9R and it's quite good phone.Pros:1: Premium build quality and finish2: Great display performance3: Excellent UI performance4: Good main camera performance in daylight5: Blazing fast charging speed (1-100 approx 45mins)6: nice stereo loudspeakers7: Oxygen OS 11 does perform very well8: Haptic feedback is just awesomeCons:1: Mediocre ultra-wide camera2: Useless monochrome camera3: Most games locked to 60Hz4: Worst camera in low light conditions5: Battery drains so fast (but you will get a 65watt charger so i don't think it's a big issue)I don't know how many of u guys facing back and home screen gesture issue while charging. But i'm facing this problem.Hopefully some cons can be fix through via software, let's see when ONEPLUS will fix it.NOTE: [ If you are looking for a good looking premium performance phone,if camera doesn't matter(it's quite good but not up to my mark), then just go for it. Otherwise if you are looking for a camera phone and performance doesn't matter then dn't go, just buy other brands ]"
115,Shreekanth,I will not recommended this to anyone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you want to buy this device please do keep below things in your mindIf you are looking for OnePlus brand logo and premium build quality phone thaen go for it otherwise i will not recommended it, previously i was a redmi note 9pro use, One plus 9R camera can't even beat my redmi note 9 pro,Camera section i will give 30/100, OnePlus really need serious improvements in camera department"
116,Deb Pramanik,Great phone with some major drawbacks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first OnePlus device so it's a little special feeling for me to review this. Let me tell you about the pros and consPros- Oxygen UI(best), display quality and refresh rate(next level smoothness), processor(SD870 is a beast), Audio O/p quality is too good(stereo speakers are doing their jobs very well) and battery back is also really good. These are all the prosCons- Camera(Honestly, camera is really bad, even 15-20k smartphones have better camera nowadays, OnePlus really disappointed me in this), Heating (after charging device heats up a bit bit i think it will be resolved with Software updates). These are all the cons.Conclusion - Dear OnePlus, Someone is paying 40000 bucks to buy this device so they deserve a great camera but unfortunately it is sooo bad, it is my request please do something with it via software upgrades.So if you want to a click amazing pictures this phone is definately not for you but if you want a decent camera with beast performance then this phone is definately for you."

118,Fashion crazy,May be called a flagship killer!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi guys,  I am writing the review after the 04 days of usage. Pros: I did not face any heating issue as people are complaining here.2. Battery easily lasts whole day in normal use.3. Due to SD 870, no problem in toggling between multiple apps.Cons: camera is average so if you are selfie crazy then you should opt for other better options available in market.2. No notch."
119,Aditya Anand,Overall Nice phone and value for money. For better knowledge read my full review.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Its fingerprint scanner is very fast. Phone is not overheating as many people were saying. I love its display quailty and its very smooth. Camera is also good. Battery was also enough for me and charging speed is really awesome.But a thing I noticed that one flashlight üî¶ is only for improving the phone's design. The first flashlight on the phone is fake.
120,Dhiren Samal,"Great battery, charging & overall experience. Bad in heating and fear of timely future updates.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  3 days Review. I'll edit down the line.1. Battery - charging really fast. 1-99% in 40min!2. Battery backup - at 120Hz, goes a full day with data on and Bluetooth TWS connected.3. Fingerprint reader - Slow while out under the sun. Average the rest of the time. Definitely not the fastest.4. Camera - photos are decent. Contrasty. Can be managed with Gcam. Videos are really stable. Even at 4K60FPS.5. Performance - blazing fast. No glitches at all.6. Haptics - Top Tier. Really.7. Heating - YES. That's the main issue. While charging or transferring data from old phone to the new phone, it's understandable. But long gaming sessions and turning on hotspots make the metal frame really hot. Like 42¬∞C+.8. Yes you could get a cheaper SD870.  Yes OnePlus has been shady when it comes to timely updates.9. Also, it's a premium experience. I've been a POCO f1 user for the past 3 years almost. So a big jump for me."
121,Vkreate Jaipur,It is just awesome ‚≠ê,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am a OnePlus user since last 6 years. And now I bought this OnePlus 9R as I was looking for a phone under 40,000. I am very happy now after buying this phone. It is really awesome. The look, display, speed , everything is at its best.People are saying that it has some heating issue. But according to me there is nothing like that. And practically when you use phone on first day and installs so many things and also do many things parallely then definitely every phone will get heatup.So don't think and go for this phone."
122,Jyothi,"Good phone, amazing display, impressive gesture features",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus 9R is a classy, premium looking phone. I received it yesterday. My first impression about phone in a day usage, is as follows:1) Lake blue colour gives attractive look with stylish camera and smooth finish.2) camera quality is nice, I don't understand y few reviewers are not happy with it. I m not a professional photographer, so for me it's absolutely good.3) Fingerprint sensor works fine.4) Facelock opens even at dim light.5) Phone doesn't heat up during regular use. I observed heating only during initial system update and also while charging which is obvious. Otherwise NO heating issue.6) Comes with wrap charging n charging speed is good.7) Battery performance is good. We have an option to change refresh rate from 120Hz to 60Hz.8) Touch is smooth, and display is excellent.9) Sound quality is awesome.10) Quick gestures response is very fast and I loved it.11) Came with good packaging.12) Back case quality is transparent n goodOnly cons are,If call recording is started, opposite person get intimated about it. Ofc i never do call recording so I don't mind about it.No 3.5 mm jack in this phone just like other costly phones. However, I am using OnePlus buds z for wireless and for wired I use type c to 3.5 mm jack connector. And it Sounds great.Overall excellent features with great display, camera, sound, n battery. No regrets."
123,praveen kumar,Not worth,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I personally feel one plus is no more the same quality brand what it used to be couple of years ago. 39 k rupees for this phone is truly unworthy of spending. Screen is fine . Camera is not great. Battery surely has to improve and yes there is over heating issues too. In less than week itself im realising the mistake. I feel vivo has more better options than this for sonmuch money.
124,Shambhoo Kumar,OnePlus 9R First Look (Worth buying),5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product looks awesome at first inhand experience. Further after using few days, I will share my experience.My review after using Phone: Phone is quite attractive. Camera quality is good. I haven't faced any heating issue till now as seeing in other reviews. Interface is good. Fast and what you want in 40k price, it maintained standardization."
125,NANDITA PAUL,Honest review.Heating issue is quite normal.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Honest review-A lot of people telling about heating issue so I am just simply adding a honest review, it's a machine not a human ,even human sometimes released heat in forms of Anger.Lol on everyone who thoughts gaming phone doesnot release heat. Every machine heated up & its quite nominal.45k you spending what you expect.I am using this for 7 hours and found heating issue which is normalfor me .Within a min it decreases almost 4¬∞temp.Iphones also released heat.Heating issue is normal as this is a machine.Thats the reason a lot of reviewers don't talk about this issue.No issue found after 10 days."
126,Aashlesh,Best flagship level phone of 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The performance is awesome and oneplus is always good at it.Only camera performance is not upto mark and this lags all behind. Overall the phone is great. If you are not concerned about cameras just go for it. The camera's are fine. Not as good as 40k phone. But they do job fine. And that's what I wanted. The charging time is 50 mins from 1%-100%The standby battery stays for 20+ hrsWith on screen time of 8+hrsThis was my experienceCall quality is best.Everything is tested under 120hz refresh rate. I can't imagine how long it will last in 60hz refresh rate.Amazing display and speakers are awesome. The haptics are close to flagship and amazing performance. Like the iPhone 7 button you used to think it was button, until you find out it was just a haptic. Not a button."
127,KSReddy,Best Affordable flagship,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  SPEED:Blazing speed with enormous memory for gaming and memory intensive apps.CAMERA:Captures Real life true colour pictures you'd fall in love.VALUE FOR MONEY: 100%I would say the best affordable flagship phone.BATTERY:With full fledged usage, the battery easily lasts for a day and it charges very fastfully in 40mins with the dashcharger.HEATING:Sometimes gets heated after gaming and long usage. Otherwise it's cool for normal users.COLOUR: I took lake BlueThe colour is very light as sky blue and not as good colour as seen in MI phones. It does not have many color options."

They forget about Customers after selling the Phone especially the Oneplus 9 Series.1/10 overall rating.Battery drains too fast in 3 - 3.5 hrs.Camera - Front camera is a jokeDisplay has sometime touch issue. It fails to register touches sometime.Speaker - Volume is low. Not audible when two persons talking in the same room.Finger print Reader - It is very slow. I have compared it with OnePlus 7 series.OnePlus is just a hype. Better go for iqoo 7.
129,Keyur Chauhan,"Heating, bad camera... it's definitely not oneplus",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using oneplus seven happily. After getting oneplus 9R I feel like oneplus really degraded its phone quality. That's not what you'd expect after spending 40K.Phone heats badly during first setup. Also camera refuses to take photos sometimes (see attached image) due to high phone temperature. This issue gets resolved after OS update. But still some heating issue persists, though not as severe as first time setup.Build quality: Decent build quality and good display. Call quality is also good.Speed: Quick and responsive.Battery n charging: Charges very quickly and battery is OK. Don't have to recharge.more than once a day for moderate usage.Camera: Image quality is OK. Honestly you'd expect great quality camera after spending 40K but it disappoints. Video quality is pathetic perticularly for indoor videos.Overall a disappointing mobile from oneplus."
130,guneet,Good Phone for the price,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I was planning to buy the one plus 9 but after disappointing reviews I decided to go for one plus 9R. I am swithing from one plus 5t and am loving my new device.Pros -Design (Carbon Black)ChargingSpeedCons -I have noticed a few software bugs here and there but nothing majorAverage main cameraBelow average selfie cameraI am a casual gamer and this phone is perfect for me. No overheating till now. All in all this is a better choice than one plus 9.
131,Tanmoy Ghoshal,Not upto the expectations that 9R advertisement has built.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dislike- i) Sensor quality. Touch sensor is poor & sometimes it has some debug (may be due to software issues in my handset). Once it got automatically restarted after 4 days of buying. ii) If you add 3 Gmail id to get your all contacts - incoming call name display will have lag of 2 seconds.Like- Night-mode camera, Battery charging time (in 30 minutes - 0 to 100%), battery life, calling sound quality."
132,Abhijit jadeja,Perfect imperfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Upgrade form 5t to 9rOverall i would sayBattery is really good it gives me 7 to 8 hours sometimes 8+ SOT  and with heavy usage like playing games n all i've got 5 to 6 hoursWhich is decent battery life.Oxygen os is hands down the best ui for android right now so nothing to complaint thereSome minor bugs which are solved by the 2nd OTA update.Camera - so the main concern was the camera and as reviews on YouTube said its not a good camera but after using OP5t and other 3 years old device this is a huge upgrade in camera for me so if you are upgrading From some 3 years or even 2 years old device you'll not dissatisfied with camera in my opinionAnd 5g band as OnePlus said that they'll give update and enable 5g bandsDon't fall for thatThey officially confirmed that OTA will not enable any other 5g band so if you want future proof 5g phone go for galaxy s20 fe 5gDisplay is so good so far as i said if you're upgrading from 3 years old device you'll love this phoneThe only concern is this device is available for only china and India so no global coverage and thats why maybe this device will not have custom rom development more than other OnePlus devices i guess ü§û

137,Siddhu,Better To Improve Battery Life.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  So, I'm new to the OnePlus User. But I'm really love in One Plus Mobiles. I've bought this device with my Xiaomi note 6 Pro exchange offer 6600/- Price Was Fine.Coming to One Plus 9R Review -  I'm writing review  of Purchasing 3rd day of this device . Mobile was awesome actually! No Major Defects and all. I'm in Love with this UI. ‚Ä¢ What I've Observed in First day was when I turned on and Signing to my Google Accounts and Fixing everything my stuff on mobile,At that time I've realised Device Got ""HEAT"" Coz of Usage. Battery Percentage is Getting Down Simply.‚Ä¢ When You turned on device itself You'll get a latest Update, Once you update to the latest. Battery Performance will be Change, Heating Issue Some be Better than Previous!!‚Ä¢ When I'm Playing COD Game, Battery Life was Better. NOT BAD & NOT GOOD. JUST BETTER!! Battery Performance Overall Rate 3/5‚Ä¢ Camera Was Fantastic. Stability Was Good, No Cons On this.‚Ä¢ Cons On App Lock Settings - There is No Option Called ""Device Get Immediately Lock After Closing App "" Once Screen Locked,Then Only App will Lock Or else if You open the App which you kept App lock Option, first time itself it will ask Lock next it won't ask lock if screen awakes!!‚Ä¢ There is no Hidden Files Option for Gallery. Option was there, But not Secured!! Just Like Hidden Album in Gallery which it is not secure. Some Different with Xiaomi Features.‚Ä¢ Fingerprint Reader Was Good. Working Awesome!!"
138,amrendra m.,Average quality mobile with this price.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the mobile on 19 April so today it's one month and 6 days.So let's review the phone based on my experience.1. Wrap charger 65 W which is superb and less than 45 minutes your battery will be 100 percent and the important part is the battery will not drain quickly as compared to the speed with the battery charges.2. Looks and feel of the phone is very good . Very smooth finishing.3. Touch sensor are very good with no problem whatsoever.4. Camera quality is very good at day times and all the other functions like nightscape, pro mode and 48 MP camera will not serve the purpose of you are very much interested in photography.5. After using for one week you will feel your phone a little okayish type.So with the price of 44k it's good to search more phones because you don't feel wow after using the cell phone for one month."
139,sravani,The mobile is not perfect but you can go for it.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using the mobile for a week, I'm writing this review.I will be rating each aspect of the phone including the OSI will be honest, intial impressions were prety bad for me because of the heating  and the battery drain issues.Overall experience (4/5): The mobile used to heat up a lot which makes it very uncomfortable to use especially during the first two days. But after some days of use and the updates, it got better.Oxygen OS(5/5): This is my first Oneplus device so I found the OS very clean and snappy.Screen(5/5): The mobile has got an amazing buttery smooth display. Once we get used to it, we can't switch back for other normal displays.Camera(3.5/5): I won't say the camera is bad but it suffers in low light conditions especially the front camera. But the rear camera really takes some good shots in effective light conditions.Build quality (5/5):The phone has a great in hand  feel and it also feels light in weight.For all those people who are holding back thinking of the heating issue.. I too faced them but it subdued after some days."
140,Sanjay t,Awesome phone with average rear camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My reviews after 10 days use : as a First time One + user..i clearly give a thumbs up to the super smooth oxygen os, the phone built is premium & sturdy. Battery back up : decent  screen time of 9hr. 30 mins, full charging takes  :45 mins. Speakers are awesome, music playback through earphones or Bluetooth speakers is louder . Awestruck by the display, its a treat to watch Netflix on this phone. I find that the network aggregation works well & the internet speed is better. Many of the apps like parallel space, app locks & other utilities etc are inbuilt. I have had interactions with the customer care & the seem to be supportive. The heating issue after the update only remains during camera usage.Cons : The only con I find is  the quality of picture taken by the rear camera. Needs improvement picture becomes over saturated & a bit dark. Selfie camera is nice though. Hoping things improve with updates"
141,Aryan m.,BANG FOR BUCK!!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  oneplus 9r is best gaming smartphone and also cheap i will tell things i like and dislike about this phone.1.camera quality is good but not excellent.and i am fine with it.2.for some reason i dont know why it takes me longer to charge(it takes like more than 40 mins) despite having 65 walts fast charging support.3.sometimes phones heats up too much even when i dont do the heavy task and sometimes even if i play games like pubg,cod mobile for like 1 hour it doesnt heat too much. i think it will be solved by future updates but its very bad issue.4.games run buttery smooth.there is no lag,no touch issues and the screen has no black spot or green tint or anythingoverall its better to buy this phone than the 9 or 9 pro because the camera quality is almost same in all three devices.i bought oneplus 9 pro before and after 3 days i returned it and bought this phone and i am really satisfied with it."
142,lalit kumar,"Overall , it is indeed a good investment in the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Details review for One Plus 9R (1 month Usage)Overall opinion - You should either buy 9R or Pro, 9 is not worth the price.‚Ä¢ The performance is amazing in terms of high end gaming or heavy apps you will not feel the lag.‚Ä¢ The camera is bit tricky to say, It can be 8/10, in the price segment, Low light is ok but not great, Wide angle is great, however macro is 50-50. Overall 8/10 for camera.‚Ä¢ Figer print and face unlock is 10/10. Even with your mask of specs it will recognise you.Battery life is great.‚Ä¢ Charging the phone is suprising super fast. Just 15 min you are good to go. Also, since phone is packed with feature, it do lose battery life bit faster then normal.Overall , it is indeed a good investment in the price."
143,vikas,Oneplus 9R Honest review,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone was pretty good. I had the 12 GB Ram 256 GB Rom variant.the battery life was very good and the charging was quite fast it had charged in 45 minutes ( with wifi and location services on ) the camera was decent not that good . I hope the camera would be better. one biggest hardware issue was that the  dual speaker ,where the upper ear speaker was not calibrated. when you play sounds louder you can feel the back vibrating it is verey noticable( above 75%of the volume)  .you can turn off dual speakers by enabling mono audio in settings .besides this everything Is goodOxygen Os Is the best os according to me------------------------------------------------------‚Ä¢For gaming and mobile experience it is good‚Ä¢And for photography its not that worth"
144,Ramesh reddy,There are few problems but worth purchasing. Go for it while you get get additional discount.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first time experience with OnePlus.1. OP9R built quality is exceeded my expectations, everything is good. I feel little heavy in my hands.2. Camere quality is good3. Fluid display is awesome, thoughtl i have used only limited time in 120Hz (to save the battery), I can very well notice the difference.4. SP 870 is simply superb, met my expectations.5. Volume and Power buttons are of great quality and gives nice feel to press.6. Aluminum fishing is lit. Gives premium feel.Cons:1. Heating issues - not very much but noticable. When you use camera, it gets heated even more easily.2. Charging speed is not like what they have advertised. It takes 50-60 mins to charge full. Disappointed with the false promises.3. Screen flickering issues while using telegram, notifications, and picking calls. (Hope they'll clear this in next update)4. Screenshots are not of great quality. My old mobile takes clear screenshots than this.5. When you tap 'Mark as read' chat notifications of telegram, they'll be still there. Don't know why.6. OnePlus lancher is consuming more battery.Over-all worth purchasing. Looking for an update where these small issues gets clear."
145,RohanGhugari,Great phone. Will get better with software updates. Would recommend 8/10.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone because I've been a OnePlus user for a long time. This phone is a great phone in the latest line of OnePlus.Battery: It is a beast when it comes to battery life. I use it at 120Hz all the time and I cannot kill it within a day. Warp charging is the chrerry on top.Display: Great display. Great color science. Accurate colors. Viewing angle is great .Camera: Underwhelming. It will get better with software updates (I hope). But as of right now its not good. There is a lag when photo is clicked. Photos come out little muted. I would recommend install Google camera.Software: Best OS other than stock. It's fast,smooth,many customisation options, bit there are little bugs but it's not a deal breaker.Sound: Good quality speakers. They are loud stereo speakers. You get the option of Dolby if you want to enhance your listening experience. Call quality is good no issues.Haptic : Good haptic motor. Strong haptic feedback.Fingerprint reader: There has not been a problem for me. It has worked for me 95 % of the time. It's fast so...no complaint."
146,Srikanth reddy,Good product from oneplus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is more valve when compared to all the 9 series phones.Impressed with the build quality, fast charging, display, Operating system, colour and design. Camaras are fine but not great. Overall, perfect phone to use in this price.Practical phone to use"
147,Dr Azhar,"Rebadged OnePlus 8T, disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's just a rebadged version of OnePlus 8T. Was excited at the beginning but got disappointed within a day to have found out its the same old phone and nothing new in it, poor camera quality lot of noise in low light pictures and it doesn't feel premium for the exorbitant price they are selling, though the phone runs smooth. OnePlus you need to up your game, or u r gonna be next nokia. Should have opted for mi 11 ultra for another 15K+ which is comparable to the likes of galaxy s21 ultra."
148,Sanjay,"Meets expectations, good buy!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First couple of days I faced battery heating issues, but now it runs pretty smooth. As usual, the oneplus camera does not disappoint and does a really good job while taking pictures.120h refresh rate makes this phone very smooth to use and while gaming as well. Overall 4 out of 5 because it does meet my expectation and I feel this is a better buy than oneplus 9."
149,Vamsi,A very good phone - from a first time flagship user,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using the 128GB version for almost a month now. I took a huge chance by getting it, but I'd say I'm satisfied with my purchase. Oxygen os made the overall usage excellent, highly optimised with a great balance of customisation. As someone who enjoys music and occasional games, I found this device to be amazing. Gets slightly warm when playing cod on maxed out graphics, but very manageable. It's not noticeable with the case provided in the box. I usually go on meetings for 1.5-2 hrs a day, haven't faced a problem with the call quality even once. Vowifi works brilliantly on Airtel in HYD. I found the display to be brilliant color reproduction wise. But I wished the highest brightness were slightly higher under direct sunlight, and the least brightness a lot lower-its way too bright for my liking in a dark room. I was slightly disappointed with the camera, but after using an Asus zenfone max pro m1 since it's launch, I can say this still is not bad at all in ideal conditions. Music output through wired earphones is amazing with Dolby Atmos, just the way I imagined a flagship to be. Earlier reviews mentioned average battery life. After the initial ota updates, I managed to extract 7+ hrs of screen on time consistently with the haptics turned off and 60hz refresh rate, with~20% remaining after 24 hrs. And the best part is, it charges up to 100% in less than 30mins. lastly, I haven't noticed any heating issues after the initial ota update. Coming to 5G, this device only supports one band- when the name prouldy includes this tag.Sorry for the long review, but this would be a 10/10 device if not for the slightly average camera and the lack of multiple 5G band support. (Overall 8.6/10)"
150,Amazon Customer,After 6 purchases of various One Plus phones.....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using one plus for more than 6 years now n this is my fiftg one - after purchasing one plus 3, then 3T, then 6 then a nord and now this one.  All of them brought thru Amazon.  All the earlier ones performed well. Infact both 3&3T r still in use. Although service team has denied offering any spare r service for both of them citing products EoL. But that's a separate problem.This 9R I bought on 29th May n put to use from 7th June onwards I must say the phones performance is underwhelming. The said 120hz of speed is actually not felt at all. Infact my one plus 6 is much faster when I use it despite that being a 8 &128 variant. This is supposedly 12&256 but I am not happy with the 12GB ram performance. Even the keypad is very bad. It keeps switching between apps while typing more often and that's damn irritating.Overall my recommendation is to NOT go for this at the price point as the performance claimed is not what you get.Am happy with warp charging though, it's r ally quick than any predecessor. Camera quality is just good nothing great to boast about."
151,JJ Joseph,Loving OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This being my first premium smartphone, I am quite happy with it after using for 3 weeks. Phone is super smooth and fast. Charging is pretty quick which takes almost 35 min to go from 0 to 100. Battery discharge is slightly quick as well but only with heavy usage. Camera quality is pretty good too."
152,Deepak,Oneplus 9R Beast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I must say oneplus 9R is definitely grab the deal offer in terms of build quality, haptic feedback, and competitive prices. Yes ofcourse some lack in camera but it's not completely bad at all you will find decent picture in pro mode, dynamic range is also good. 120hz buttery smooth. Oxygen os simply amazing, now come to battery, it will give you almost 12hours for average user. Product is awesome and loveable. On first set up, user will find an update some tweaks. Metallic frame gives you strong build quality the same is not available in OnePlus 9. user will get 109gb out of 128gb.Delivery with 2 days for prime in Chennai."
153,Manu,Practical choice among OnePlus 9 series,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. PERFORMANCE -Well 870 processor working upto the mark I would say.I'm not a heavy gamer anymore but did some gamingLike Bgmi, Nba 2k20 (3 gigs), CodmLemme start with BgmiPhones display runs on 120hz and Bgmi on 60 max for now (software update may change that)You'll feel like it's lagging, well display just shifted from 120 to 60hz sooo it's obvious butFrame rate were constant 58-60 (Hd+extreme)Also Bgmi is buggy and glitchy.Nba and Codm felt more smooth.Score - 9/102. CAMERAOnly weak point of this phone I would say.Let me make this clear first.Not the camera sensor is bad but it's the software optimization that is bad.I attached some photos above you can check.First photo is taken from stock app and later one from gcamFollow the same order for the latter pics.As you can clearly see the difference that pic from gcam were more detailed and contained more natural colour. Dynamic ranges are also good.Last one is from stock cam with little bit of editingVideo - I don't shoot videos much so I don't know for sure but one thing is worth mentioning is that it has OIS that OnePlus 9 doesn't. (So much for flagship device)Again software optimization needed in camera department.Score - 7.53. DISPLAY120hz smooth afVery less tint on display which is known in amoled high refresh rate displayYeah there is pink tint when you view it from charger socket point but no one uses a phone from that angleAlso there are some flickering on lowest brightness also common in amoled screensScore - 84. OSOOS is the most cleanest UI out there in market after pixel uiRam management is more than enoughAnd now OnePlus made an announcement that they will provide 3 major android update + 4 years of security patch updateScore - 9Overall - 8.3Overall very good device"
154,Tony c.,At this price point actually am not satisfied,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This how I actually see the phone from my point of view,The phone's processor is very much powerful and heavy gaming efficient.The battery is a major setback, although you turn down all the performance related quirks (like tuning down from 120hZ to 60hZ and turning off the ambient display) in the phone, it still seemed to drain quiet fast. It's just good for a day's normal use.The phone had severe heating issues, like seriouslyüòë, it's ok if it gets heated up during a gaming session but during watching YouTube at 1080 p and Netflix, watching ig reels, n during online shopping like for realüôÑ. The phone gets really hot when charged.Coming to charging, I was actually baffled by the fact that the phone gets fully charged within 34 minutes (prolly the reason why it gets heated real bad) other than that hats iff to 65w charging.Other than that the OS provides a really user friendly experience and provides more customisation to your preference and tastes.The camera is flawless and am not disappointed, but low light selfies can be better.The phone's build is so sturdy and really premium in hand with a metal frame and gorilla glass on the front as well as back.Note: The black 9r provides a matte finish back aka frosted glass and the blue 9r provides a glossy finish.This was my opinion of the phone, as a whole a really good and potential phone with minor tweaks and updates it may take its place in the flagships."
155,Amazon Customer,Can't install apps !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received my OnePlus 9r today ie 25 April 2021 and when after setting up the device, I tried to install various apps I found out that a lot of apps cannot be installed. Apps like instagram, Paytm, all amazon apps can't be installed. I had a word at the OnePlus customer care and tried both hard and soft factory reset but the problem still persists. Since we have too many covid cases here in Ghaziabad, going to the service center is not a viable option.Will be returning this phone if the problem remains.Edit: All apps got installed after a patch update. Not replacing the phone, will update the review again after a few weeks."
156,Serlin,Superb device with palm warming technology,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  My device is a 12GB - 256GB variant, and by experience and score for the device is given below.Design & Build - 3.5 star, very handy and access to physical switches and Back camera positioning is appreciable. In hand, feels like premium. Thickness and weight distribution is good. Phone heating will help to overcome the winter season's extreme cold. Summer season, recommend to use in indoors and in air-conditioned rooms.Screen - 4 star, brightness is good. 120hz smoothness is not much noticeable for a normal user. Fingerprint scanner position in screen is easy to use. Extended use will bring the heat to the screen.Camera - 3 star for Normal, Portrait & Wide Shoots & 4 star for Macro & Video Stabilization & 0 star for Tele and Other features. Night and Panorama shots are completely waste. Close enough to a 15-20k phones. Selfie photos will amaze you !!! , there is no match with real face shape.Battery - 3 Star, Normal user require 2 times charging in a day. Heavy users, plug n play recommend. Over heating is the main thing will get noticed even for Normal users. Recommend to use in winter season for a warm feel in Palms.Charger - 4.5 Star - It is the only thing which delivered the results as per the ADs. While charging also it get warm but need not to worry, it will only take 30-35 min for full charge.Recommend to keep it in a flat metal surface while charging, so that heat will be distributed to the metal and keep the device cool.Overall experience and score - Average & 3.5 star.OnePlus Goodwill is the only thing people are buying this phone. This would be the model which will help the brand to be with average and below average phone makers.Not recommend for Normal users (Hope Heavy gamers understand) if you really want to have this model, Buy Ice water bag along with this, would help to reduce the heating issue ü§™üòúüòù."
157,Ujjawal,Pros and Cons both covered.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great Device .Pros and cons are mentioned below:1. Battery life : Very good at 60Hz and okayish at 120 Hz which is very obvious.It would have been better if there was an automatic refresh rate option. I have seen it in realme device of 12_15K price segment  . Found that feature impressive. But sadly it is not in oneplus 9R.2. Screen quality is excellent.3. Camera (Stock) is not satisfactory , but with G-Cam u will be able to click superb quality pictures with natural colours and lot of details in pictures.4. No lag at all. Feels so so smooth even at 60 hz . It would have been better if there was 90 hz option as well , which is intermediate to both 60 and 120 .5. Gaming : Pubg running without any lag . Even in hotdrops no lag was observed. Battery consumption is also satisfactory.6. Charging: The best part of this phone. In 20 minutes it went from 20% to 83% and takes around 35 _38 minutes in 0% to 100%.7: Heating : Max i observed was 39_40 degree C during setting up of the phone.In gaming the temp goes around 34_38 which is perfectly fine i guess.No overheating was observed till now.Writing this review after 3 days of usage.Thanks."

159,Akshay,A decent piece of tech with a few shortcomings.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would say the phone is okay because I feel it's almost there but it's still miles away from being the best, I saw a lot of stigma for the OP 9 lineup maybe it's true maybe it's not that is subjective, but as far as I can tell phone does get warm at times I think a couple of updates would get rid of the heating issues.The stock cameras are good, I tried the Google cam trust me fellow buyers the quality was magical, im sure it will impress you.One major issue I faced the calls tend to drop abruptly that's one annoying thing im facing.Many major apps need optimization for instance YouTube sometimes doesn't feel like 120hz that's a bummer I want the dev team to address this asap.Frequent times a few apps don't open but give it a moment or 2 it responds.Ahh I hate to say this but the audio output this thing produces is just crap just plain garbage I use expensive earphones like xb75 ap Sony it makes it sound average no extensive settings available in Dolby atmos I demand oneplus fixes this issue.I'm not a great reviewer but this is my honest opinion hope this helps."
160,Pankaj,Perfect Flagship phone by oneplus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  i am writing this review after use of one week.This my first experience with OnePlus brand and i really impressed with the performance for which OnePlus knows. it's just super in every aspect like Display, Performance, Battery charging speed and aesthetic point of view. only problem which is observed on my phone is its dual led flash at back side and one of the led is not working, please help me to get this issue fix."
161,Vishal Agarwal,Great performance with best UI nd fluid display but with an Average Camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Oneplus is Oneplus no major complaints from this phone but the wired thing was.. While unboxing the phone, ""I was surprised as the phone was in ON state in the box.""This is first time i have seen a phone inside a box with open screen.Rest camera is good for day time... In low lights it catches grains nd noise.Yeah the phone heats easily but I hope they will resolve this with future updates.In-display-fingerprint is not that fast like we get in Rear nd side panels but this also ok.Rest everything is best in this phone... Either it is display, smoothnes of UI, customization, fast charging,Ambient Display,etc."
162,Manish Kumar,Value for money phone in OnePlus 9 series,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is really good. Initially I was sceptical after reading about the heating issues, but I don't see any heating issues as such on this phone. Seema the issue might have got resolved. The performance of the phone is significantly good and feels like a premium phone. A good deal for me indeed"
163,Hanish,Awesome Display and Performance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  i have been using this device as my daily driver from past one week and here is a detailed review.Pros:1. Great Display.2. Best performance.3. Good Haptic feedback.4. Best user interface out of all android phones.5. It really charges very fast -- helps people who charge their phone after waking up.6. Very good touch response.7. Dark theme customisations are really good.8. Decent camera for 40k price (dynamic range is better than samsung galaxy S20 FE)9. OnePlus community is really cool, if u have any problem you can instantly get suggestions from people all around the world.10. This phone is having very good ambient display notifications.11. If you are a ""Gamer"" then this mobile is for you.Cons:1. Back case issued in the box doesn't gives enough protection for you rear camera, but gives good protection for display.2. Battery discharges quick even if it is 4500mah, OnePlus need to work on it.3. Few users are facing heating issue, i didn't have it.4. Phone is very big can't operate with one hand.5. Some apps are getting crashed (software bugs so can be corrected from an update).6. Average rating for Night light mode in camera.7. This Phone is little bit bulky than my older device.8.

164,AB,Damaged screen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  You see that tiny speck in the pic? It's the damaged screen, that I've got on my new phone. This is unacceptable Amazon, Darshita electronics and OnePlus. 43k was what I paid to get a damaged screen on new phone.Edit - I was given a new phone by Amazon. The problem with the first one was,it was a used handset.The phone that was delivered previously did not have a screen guard (the basic one that comes with every phone). My replaced device has a screen guard."
165,Amazon Customer,Worst phone in the market,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Constantly getting pop-up for Google Play services not functioning. There's a pop-up every 3-4 seconds. Has made the phone unusable! Apart from this, even regular apps like whatsapp hang. This phone isn't even one month old and looks like a complete disaster. Had OnePlus 5 before this and it worked like a charm till the screen broke recently. Will never buy OnePlus again."
166,P,Worst phone purchased in last 10 years,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone works extremely slow, takes 2-3 minutes to delete 2+ pictures selected together, hangs 10-15 times a day, camera is worse than oneplus 5. Ideally, I would want to return this piece of junk but Amazon's policy says it can't be returned. But getting a replacement has become mammoth of a task. All in all, a terrible experience with this phone and Amazon's policies of refunds and replacements because a 40k worth of phone is of no use to me in the first 2 weeks of purchase."
167,Chinu sekh,One plus is the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  No complaints. The best quality is vapour cooling. when Phn gets heated it automatically cools down to normal temperature. Camera quality is good. I am satisfied. For better graphics go to game mode and enable graphics optimization.
168,Good product .,Good phone don't expect much,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Honestly, a good phone. Don't expect too much. It's a base version of 9 series. Build quality is very good, sound is stereo and you will enjoy it. Screen is very good. Battery life is amazing after update. Catches range everywhere. Phone call is very crisp and clear. Very fast performance.Only disappointed by camera. Very average quality."
169,Rajesh Chouhan,Best budget phone to buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its been a month since I have been using this phone (12+256), below are the pros and cons.PROS:1. Amazing build quality2. Comes with good ram and storage power3. Superfast in some sections4. Scintillating camera quality5. Refresh rate is fantastic6. Enabled face detection,  works smoothly7. Bettery stand-up time is around 9 to 12 hrs on Normal use.CONS:1. I have12gb ram variant but gmail app is drastically slow, I was not able to reply someone.2. Gallary photos are loading very very slow, disappointed in these 2 sections as of now, will keep updating3. Eventhought the Alexa is in built had to download the app and its not upto the mark.Overall:The Best product in this range. If you have this much budget GO 4 IT."
170,Nishant Tomer,Poor camera and heating issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not a good phone for this price range. Poor camera performance and heating issue make it the worst phone in this price range.
171,Sumanth Aradhya,Absolute midrange master!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great looking phone with great hardware and software. Snapdragon 870 processor gets things done in a snap. Fast charging is great, charge for 20-30 mins and you are covered for a complete day with normal usage. Camera does a great job with natural light as well night light with amazing nightscape option. Top-class product from a top-class brand. Heating issues are noticed during heavy usage and charging, but also depends on room temperature, hope this will be fixed with upcoming software updates."
172,Vaibhav Saxena,Good camera quality and built quality.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I bought onePlus phone for the first time and the overall phone seems to be surprising.The device has a sleek design with glass front and backThe ""camera quality"" especially seems to be awesome.You have setting for taking pics in 2 formats 12MP &48MpP and both work good.Battery is super fast charging and the discharge of battery is not to high (depending the apps in background)Faced some overheating issue in the starting but not consistent,may be because the device would be doing some multiple tasks after boot.Overall the phone is good and is worth the price"
173,MOHAN KUMAR,Check for issues,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  People i faced major call drop issues and I would not be able to hear during a call, also automatic Bluetooth connectivity for wireless headset fails. Camera is bad. Apart from that rest okay. I'm moving from one plus 3T to one plus 9r but now going for replacement."
174,Shashank Verma,Product delivered without any damage and with safety. Happy with my delivery.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The new one plus 9R is a Xerox copy of its brother 8T. In the tech world it's an unwritten saying that you should go with the latest. Hence chose 9R over 8T. Phone is handy for me as I do have big hands, some might find it a little tough to handle. Performance is amazing. Photo quality is pretty good. With some basic photography knowledge you can click the right photo acc. to the sutuation, however if you want better looking (colour wise) pics, you might be interested in getting a higher version of One Plus 9. Battery life is sufficient enough to survive a day and it charges in 45-50 mins when left ideal. If you want to know more in detail, you can dm me on instagram (@the_bearded_chevalier)"
175,aravind,"Good device at Market now,but no value for money",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera: I am satisfied with back camera,but coming to front camera in the night mode expecting better camera ,not value for interms of front cameraPerformance: excellent mainly for gamingScreen resolution: wonderful, mainly Oxygen OS is adding beauty for this deviceProcessor: no words, excellentBattery: no words , excellentValue for money : when compared to the same configuration I am getting other branded mobile at the price of 30k ,but one plus brand is failed to provide quality camera so I can't say this model is value for money ,if it was 30-35 k price range ,I definitely give 5 stars"
176,Nikhil Srivastava,Want a best 5G flagship budget phone ? Go for One plus 9r,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†My experience of this phone is really good, fingerprint reader is working smooth, battery life ok I had used this phone for at least two days and I realised that you have to charge this phone at least twice if you are using normally and you have to charge it thrice or four times if you are using heavy and at last the camera quality is awesome.if you are a gamer then the gaming experience and performance of 9r is awesome.if you are looking for best camera best performance 5G phone then you should go for one plus 9r, overall if you look at this phone, it is best flagship budget phone."
177,Kunal,This is an awesome device.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Serious heating issues while changing it overheats and while playing games or doing any heavy tasks this phone heats like it it's burning. And phone is not well optimized and oneplus is not giving updates to this as doing for pro models and phones seriously lags and stuck apps even apps are crashing camera is worst ever. Battery life is ok but charging is good but the worst thing is snapdragon 870 it is not properly optimized worst experience ever even gallery of phone stucks and takes a lot of time to load images. Better go for iPhone 11 YouTubers are right about this I'm regretting after using this phone. After updates every thing is fixed it is really better than iPhone 11 after updates every is superb now.
178,Ananth,All about software and speed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sold my OnePlus 6(which was still a beast but the volume button was not working properly) and bought this phone. If you have used a OnePlus phone, then this phone will satisfy you.Pros of this phone *for me*:-Oxygen os (fast & minimal)-Camera (compared to other flagship phones, camera is not that good but it's really good compared to OnePlus 6)-Charging speed (really fast charging but there is some heating issue)-Speaker/sound/mic/call quality (very good compared to OnePlus 6)-Very minor heating while gaming (played cod for around 40 mins, the phone heated up maybe 1 or 2 degrees compared to normal temperature)-Display (for the cost, display is excellent)-Fast processor (in practical usage, you won't see that much difference between Snapdragon 888 & 870)-No defects/bugs/issues except for the heating issue while charging-Battery (I'm not a hard-core gamer/user and I easily get 1 day battery)Cons *for me* :-No headphone jack (it was there in OnePlus 6 ü•≤. If you use a Bluetooth earphone/headp hone this is not a con for you)- No LED light/indicator"
179,Himani,Not as per legacally 1plus phones,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It is switching off in evry 1 mins if i am using camera for long.The camera quality is very poor looks like a 5k local phone.screen size is too small as compared to my earlier 1plus 6 phone.Big No
180,Ehsanul Haque,Good but not the best in the price segment.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus is a brand that can be trusted.One Plus 9R is a really good device that will give you a good and proper flagship experience. The camera could be a little better. But still at this price range, there are better alternatives. Don't just buy it impulsively. Check other devices like IQOO7 or MI 11X and think about the device which suits your needs."
181,ARNAB BHAUMIK,Very good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a good phone for official usage. The UI is very good as well as a very good feeling of haptic feed back. You will have a feather touch like experience. Very good sound quality. While using headphone you will get Equalizer settings which improve customize sound quality.Good build quality.Good display.Good sound.Decent camera.We will find heating using but it is for the natural characteristics of the 877 processor. You will find the same issue for all the 877 processor phones.Camera in low light and front camera is not very best. Just do a decent work.Not good for Gamers.
182,Sushmita ,Good phone. But it could have been better,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after using the mobile for a month: (15/7/21)Battery stays for 24-30 hrs easily (i continously watch series and movies and sometimes i play games also)I didn't face any heating issues. Only while charging, it warms up a bit.I received the mobile Today.. At first, I was very much scared after reading so many negative comments. But let me tell you my experience.Design: 5/5Fast Charging: 5/5Camera: 4/5 (I agree with what everyone says. The Camera could have obviously been better being a OnePlus product.)Battery Life: 4/5Heating Issue: I agree that during setup, it warms up... but very little.. It's not like it heats up.Amazon Service: 5/5Weight: Little heavy.This is my first impression review.. I will definitely again edit and update it after a month. :)Till then, happy shopping :)"
183,Amazon Customer,One of the Very good mobile Go for it ü§≥ü§òü§ò,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One of the best display.Touch feel is very smooth.camera quality is best in the segment.oxygen os 11 is  also good.I will charge the phone 25 minutes Battery was fully charged.If you watch the movie  display is superb clarity and brightness because of 120 HZ fluid amoled display.Gaming is awesome of this phone.If you buy mobile no doubt GO IT and Take it.üëå
184,Malyaj Sirothia,Amazing mobile with couple of negligible issues,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing phone.Lucky to be in a country where 9R was launched üò¨The only issue I see till now is the mobile heats up a bit and discharge very quickly. Maybe oneplus will improve it with further software updates.Its the only reason I'm giving 4 stars
185,Abdul k.,Extremely happy with the performance .,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The people criticizing battery and heating issue i think are fake. As performance is amazing battery is also superb with no heating while playing pubg for 3+ hrs camera is also good. Loved this oneplus set
186,Himanshu Joshi,Beauty & Beast with Bad Optics!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Will keep it simple. Coming from SD 636 to this, it's a major upgrade for me. Multitasking is superb, smooth operations, Oxygen OS is fascinating, 120hz Amoled Display gives wonderful browsing experience. Battery backup around 6-7hrs SoT, warp charging is at another level (around 45mins from 0 to 100). Camera is average, may be below average at this price range (quality at par with 20k phone). Low light captures are awful. If performance and UI experience is the preference, then it's a thumbs up, if the preference is photography, then it's a compromise. And, one more thing, this phone is a beauty, it looks adorable, very elegant and feels premium while holding it (black variant)."
187,Kish,Phone is good but not customer experience,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Since i had a very bad experience with amazon on few days back purchase of same phone. I tried to do a last reorder since screen guard and cover had all come. I had to pay extra 1000 rs for my old exchange phone. They started to decrease the phone value each time I was trying to order and it was failing.  Phone is really good and exchange went very smooth this time
188,Devendra Singh,Worst camera on a flagship phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have paid 40K for this phone considering that it would give some good camera results but highly disappointed with the camera performance, it doesn't even stand a chance against 2 generations old one plus 7 or iPhone SE camera. Don't go for this one instead by old one Plus 7T Pro or 8 pro"
189,Rajlakshmi,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  During initial days ,there was a heating issues but after updates , there is no such heating issues even after using for 2-3 hrs continuously. During charging also, no such heating issues.Warp charger works great. Full charge in around 50 mins.Phone is working very smoothly. Matte black finish gives it a very royal texture.Camera quality is also nice.Battery - even after heavy use,20%battery still remains .  Again warp charger is there. 15 min and it is 50% charged. Ready to work.All together, phone is not bad. Happy with the phone."
190,Amit Tiwari,Not good product,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bad product not as expected.Heating problem camera quality is not as expected give blurred image.At this cost not satisfied with product.All the expectations were ruined off.Never suggest to any one to buy this product.Insteda of this we go for Motorola samsung

195,D. Singh,Good for its price point but could have been better.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Finger print sensor takes a while to unlock the phoneCamera is not upto the price point. It seems that filters aree applied.Battery backup is good. Charges the phone completely in almost 30 minutes.
196,Akash,Camera struggles during night time,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is practically a really good phone.Minor bugs here and there with Oxygen OS but doesn't bother much.Camera photos and videos are really good during day time but struggle at night.Photos soften when you zoom into a pic, that is where the photo loses details but when viewed normally the result is good.Battery backup is decent, you get 5-6 hours of screen time. Screen time depends on the usage like camera, gaming, full brightness.Don't fall into the trap of reducing the refresh rate to save battery, it makes no sense if you have brought a phone for a feature and not using it. The battery is optimized enough for a seamless 120Hz experience."

199,Naman,OP is Value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is as good as expected, need to charge for only 30-35min (as it has 65W charging), and you can use it for a day.Camera is also good, no questions for camera lense.Suggestion :- Need to upgrade camera lense, as they are using the same since op 6.Value for money :- For 38k it's a flagship phone, as it comes with Snapdragon 870, 65W charging, in built finger print scanner, fast face unlock, and many more things."

202,Not Your Business,My review after 30 days of use.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone has been absolutely wonderful to use. I will list some pros and cons below.Camera(Con)- One thing this smartphone lacks is decent rear camera. In open areas with natural lighting it takes some wonderful shots, but in artificial or indoor lighting it is absolutely poor and blurry. The front camera is also not that good and if you are looking for a phone with good camera system, this might be a deal breaker for you.Software(Pro)- This was one of the major reasons I went for this phone over the Iqoo cos of Oxygen OS, safe to say its one of the best OS I have ever used and for me, there were a little bugs here and there, however overall nothing major.Gaming(Con and Pro)- This was a phone designed for gamers with the SDG 870. Have had no issue of frame drops or stuttering while playing games. The problem is, it doesn't support playing games at 120Hz even with games which can run at 120fps. For some that might be a deal breaker.Heating- I have seen some reviews where people are complaining about heating issues. I did face about 42¬∞C while playing some games. The thing is SDG 8XX series chipset have always had heating issues. The 888 has an even worse heating issue. So if 40+ degree temps scare u I suggest not buying a Snapdragon 8XX series phones.Display (Pro)- This display at this price point is really good. I have had no issues with it personally. Like the colours are definitely better than the last phone I used. The screen is just bright enough that you can see it in direct sunlight. Can't be a little more bright tho.Fingerprint reader(Pro) - The in-display fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest and unlike the OP 9 and 9 Pro is positioned in a much better spot. Sometimes has trouble detecting fingerprint, otherwise have had no problems.Speakers(Pro)- These are the best speakers you can get at this price, both the speakers are really loud. So much that I normally don't use them at a volume higher than 60 percent.Battery Life- I use 2 Sims and am a very heavy user, I tested it once and it gave me around 7.30 hrs of screen on time with 120Hz on, which is pretty decent for a phone with a powerful chipset. The 65W charger is also there to charge your phone in 15-20 mins from 40-100 percent.Some things I wanna add is that it has a really good haptic feedback, it's not buzzing like the Xiaomi phones, it's a much more firm vibration.Hopefully this review was helpful in your decision of purchasing this phone or not."
203,Athi,Still good phone not an excellent category,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm posting this review after 3 weeks of my normal usage.OnePlus is already reached some high level in performance. But that's not enough. Most of people mentioned pro's. So let me go with what the issues I faced.Here I faced some issues.Battery charging issue. If the phone is dead if you plugged in charger you have to wait 3 min for starts charging. Until that you can see message like battery too low wait for while to getting some charging. After started charging it won't start charging in warp charge more for again 2 to 3 min. And full charge taking about 50 min. Note: my room temperature under 25 degree. And I'm using proper power supply. Battery discharging is High it can improve. For a normal usage SOT About 5 to 6 hrs maximum. But it can be improved. All the issues can be done via software update.And coming to the camera still poor from OnePlus. Even cheap rate phones doing better job. I'm talking About both front and rear camera. There are lots issue there. Autofocus issues there, quality of the video is not good as it's 40k mobile overall camera quality should improve.Coming to gallery.... I can't believe. I think there is some bugs in it. Preview loading much time and the most irritating thing is if you wanna delete 4 images from gallery you have to wait for 10sec. All the 4 images below 3MB in size. Believe it is running in Snapdragon 870. Still I'm facing the issue after 3 update.Hope all the above mentioned issues can sort out via OTA Update. Other than everything fine. I should mention About oxygen OS it's butter smooth."
204,Sharon,A big no...,1.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus ... So delicate phone ... Previously I had I phone but I decided to go with one plus 9 r this time... Before I could use and know  the phone better it slipped from my hand and on 12th day of buying it the entire back glass broke ... Now there is no worranty for this thing and I am so devastated... So if u want to feed the dragon (one plus) then keep on visiting their service center...
205,Ansh S.,Worst phone by OnePlus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using one plus 9r for 1 month. Too many issues with this one plus phone.1.Heating issue temperature exceeding 50¬∞C while playing gamesAnd while normal usage scrolling also heating too much2.Fingerprint sensor not working perfectly in one time.3. Everytime window is poping up app isn't working properly refer image4.camera is not worthy for the price5. Sometimes keyboard is not working properly whenever i try to type keyboard keep closing
206,Susheel kumar gupta,Isma Paisa Lagane Ke Baad Ye To Lena Galat He Hai,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  First problem_ when someone's call is coming on your phone, then your phone tone will get light but light raat me nhi will burn, if you say silence, you think of the phone when you find out from the light, then forget the second problem when you call  If you want to unlock the phone and wakeup the phone, the screen does not work without double tap, the third big problem is you cannot open the phone with face unlock at night.  Worth it, diagnosing the battery problem, turning the screen from 120 to 60 takes a day or so, but it only lasts, the biggest problem with this phone is that you can't use the Epson printer app in it.  Can only work with wi-fi printer with cable does not connect"
207,Rakesh Pallapotu,Nice phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Good one. Look and feel is awesome. And a new update is only the default Messaging app allows to get OTP's any other sms apps like Textra etc. you will be able to send msgs but the receiving msgs is blocked....
208,Gaurav,Massive overheating,1.0 out of 5 stars,  What a disaster! It is affecting my health. A temperature of 45.8 degrees at normal usage is unacceptable
209,User,Battery and Camera are not so promising. Rest is fine.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery is draining fast even with GPS, Bluetooth and NFC turned-off. Basically you need to tone-down refresh rate amd ambient display to save battery, which eventually makes it a basic phone."
210,Md Maruf Mallick,A mixed review from an OP 9R user,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nothing more to say about OnePlus. Who purchases OP they already do the research. Few things I want to share is that:1.Phone is little heavy. I was a Samsung user so comparatively OP 9R is heavy for my hands. I can't see a whole movie holding this phone it gives pain.2.Phone's display is absolutely fabulous refresh rate is awesome.3.No hassleBlad is used in camera but still its a very good camera I would say.4.I have seen a little bit wifi issues. Once wifi network goes it won't come again automatically. Manually I have to disconnect it then reconnect it.5.Phone's body colour variations is very limited.It should be more.Rest of the things are well.I would recommend to go for it.
211,Himanshu Kumar,Amazing one+,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Before buying i saw the review and i got demotivated but still I purchased and trust me this is just waoo. Truly amazing product with smart specifications. I don't know why people not satisfied with the product which is good and always find loophole and make the product bad in the eyes of othes.Highly recommend you to buy this and Chuck all the negative feedback and create your own experience. I bought it and till now I have not faced any issue not even heating problem.
212,BhaveshKumar,OnePlus 9R,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice phone.One day backup battery is good.Good touch response.Good gaming experience.Nice colour.Charging is good.This is my second phone on oneplus family.Previously I am using oneplus 6T.Overall very good experience with oneplus.Performance is too good.Camera is also average of ok.Need some improvement like waterproof and camera.
213,amit kumar,Best phone in this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:- 1. Charging speed is very fast, full charge in 40min.2. Processor (SD870) is so fast that it can run every game very smoothly. I played PUBG, COD, Genshin Impact.3. Refresh rate is 120HZ which make screen looks very smooth.4.

215,Debanjan Chatterjee,OnePlus- still the budget flagship king!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Even though OnePlus wouldn't like to hear this, but they are way better at making budget flagship killers than flagships, and the 9R is yet another example of that. If you want a super fast phone with clean software experience which looks and feels like a flagship, then this is the phone. Value for money wise, the 9 and 9 Pro, loses handedly to the 9R. The metal frames and glass back, feels premium, the high refresh rate and high touch sampling rate makes the phone silky smooth. The camera experience will be adequate for most users. The 65W warp charging is another extremely practical and useful feature. Keep in mind the 9R is basically the 8T(voted Smartphone of the year 2020- Mrwhostheboss) wrapped in a new design and an overclocked CPU, if you don't really care about the new design, feel free to save an additional 1K by going for the 8T."
216,Mohit Tayal,Superb Mobile...!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was quite reluctant before buying this phone as I heard about heating issues and that was the main concern kept me enough distant from buying this phone.But I finally ordered this with a view to simply return if there is anything wrong or heating issues.But now I am glad that I ordered it and it doesn't heat, performance is great, UI experience is awesome.Camera isn't bad at all. I will give it 8.5 out of 10."
217,Shivshankar Sahoo,Overall a great product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Device is great. Works fast, feels smooth and delivers great performance. The usual specs work as promised by OnePlus.Pros:UI: It is very clean and jitter free. No bloatware, no ads, no bullshit. Although Oxygen OS has little less features than its competitors, clean OS experience has no match!Battery: Great. Easily gives you 5.30 to 6 hours screen on time for normal usage.Performance and In hand feel: SuperbRAM Management: Great to see how it handles lots of apps.Cons:Scanners: Face unlock and fingerprint scanners are good but could have been more better. They fail to work 2 out of 10 times. Also I felt the animations for fingerprint scanner is slow.Speaker Vibration: Speakers are great, but the vibration you will feel on the back side while playing media is a bit frustrating üôÅYou can turn off the top speaker to get rid of it or give it some days you will get used to it.Camera colours: Yes the reviewers were right, the colour saturation could have been better."
218,JC,Works well.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It works well. Have no complaints.
219,ESHAN GARG,"UnBudget phone (256GB, 12GB RAM)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly the cover of the phone --- Its sucks big time, ITNA BADA never settle kaun light hai bhaiya.About the phone :Processor : Its better than any samsung phone with this pricing.Battery : This is the USP of Oneplus phone and it will not disappoint you.Charging : Its like 30 mins nahi toh free....improved and best in this classScreen resolution: I think they need to work  a lot on this still not good...samsung is better and Apple is bestCamera : Not that great..Compared it with Samsung A32..and guess who wins..SAMSUNG..didn't even though of comparing it with AppleHeating Issues: This issue is common in one plus phone have faced in all the model till Oneplus 6T. They have worked on it or may be its a new phone so on first charge the backside was bit hot but it never happened again.Matt finished back side which makes it slipfree.In my opinion with this price there are better phones in the market. One plus has now become Upper middle class phone who wants a good android phone."
220,Balkrishna,Avoid negative reviews! This is the best u can get under 40K bucks.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  don't know why people are posting negative reviews, believe me this is best thing that can happen to u, just go for it blindly.Am using OnePlus since last 6 years, my last mobile was OnePlus 6 and now upgraded to OnePlus 9R, worth every penny."
221,DILLIP,Just ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Poor camera quality, apps not showing full screen notch , banking apps not working, not optimised properly. Iqoo 7 legend is best option instead of 9R except OS"
222,K Divya,Worst fellows one plus team,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  My phone has lot of heating issue,I called cutomer care, I spent 43000 bugs . They are refusing to replace, said me to install myself cpuz software. If it spoils I am going to curse them very badly. Worst products don't go on brand.it just June 9 I bought. Ifeel they could have replaced."
223,Amazon Customer,Not as per the expectations,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I am writing the review after using the mobile for one month.Cons1. While charging phone is heating.2. Oneplus is saying wrap charge and full charge just takes 35 min. But its not happening Day1 onwards3. Now I observed mobile charging is taking more than 2 hrs.4. Its not a scratch proof screen. Definitely scratch card is required. Paying 40K and Oneplus is not providing the scratch proof screen. Its very bad5. if you play the games more time phone is heating.Procs1. process is good but i didn't play very big games.2. camera is good.
224,venkat nagendra,Phone is heating up too much,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Everything thing is good Except the phone is heating without any gaming or heavy usage
225,Kartikey ,Great bang for buck,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone from past 1 month and it's a good bang for buck . One plus always makes good allrounder phones and this one is no different . Processor is good although it's not the top tier but it does its work . Battery life is really good and charging speed too . Although same old story with the camera but it's usable but not to a person who wants a phone for the camera . Gaming performance is really good , I have played a few titles ( pubg , cod , genshin impact etc...) And there isn't fps drops , just a tad bit , combined with the 120 hz fluid amoled it really bumps up the experience . Overall my thoughts that if you are a one plus fan 9R is the most value for money you will find in the OP 9 series . Final rating are -Performance 8.5/10Battery 9/10Charging speed 10/10Camera 6.5/10Display 9/10Build quality 9/10"
226,Narasimhan Gopalan,Good performance oriented phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am writing this honest review after a week's usage. This is my first one plus phone. Was using realme XT prior to this.First of all the packaging and delivery by Amazon deserves a 5 star.Below are my observations- Build quality is very good and sturdy with Alumium casing.-Display is very good. 120 Hz is very smooth to use.-Battery life is little above average for this price if you are a heavy user. Games drain the battery faster than expected. However the 65w warp chager charges the phone very fast and hence this nullifies the disadvantage of battery life. So not too worry about the battery.-Call quality is excellent-Camera is average for this price- fingerprint reader is best- sound quality is very good. The dual speakers is very good experience for watching movies . Dolby Atmos is an added advantage while using headphones- Performance is ultimate feature of this phoneOverall this is a good phone. People can opt for it but its overpriced at least 5k to 6k over and above its actual worth. If cameras were made better it would have been a definite value for money phone.
227,Vijay,Best To Buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am Using This Mobile For More Than 20 Days and Writing a Review.There is Nothing To Say The Problem, Except A Very Lite Heating Issue but This Issue Is Also For Limited Period Of Time and Later It Gets Cool Down.Camera Performance and Quality Is Really Awesome especially Night Shots.Value For Money and Worth To Buy.Charging Speed Is Really Awesome With 65watts Wrap Charger.Overall the Mobile Is Worth To Buy."
228,Abhishek Lal,User Feed back after 1 week usage.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Switching from Samsung S series was a tough decision to make. But after going through multiple online vlogs and reviews I finally made up my mind to buy one.The touch screen is an absolute delight to use, the phone charges really fast with 65w charger. The data transfer between old and new phones is hassle-free using OnePlus Switch App. The camera's quality is good enough but don't expect DSLR quality pictures. The touch and feel of the phone are delightful."
229,Prakyat Shetty,Good Phone but not the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone works flawlessly except for some ocassional heating , camera is ok , performance is very good , heats up when used for a longer duration bit it's kinda like luke warm. User experience is very good due to oxygen OS and display quality is good , does not have any tinting issues. Battery drain is minimal but felt it as I came from a bigger battery phone. Charging for 0-100 40 mins as I observed. Good phone for day to day usage."
230,Md Faze Haque Momin,Don't buy this phone!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone  should be 20000. Too much expensive. Charging is fast but battery life is poor in only 1 hour battery will dead. Selfi camra in not good in my old vivo selfi camera was better than it. And back camera don't capture natural photo. While i was waching a video mobule suddenly. Off.
231,abhijeet bhapkar,My 1st ever oneplus device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  i have been using Xiaomi devices since Mi3 launched.... arround 7 years i was using Xiaomi devices.... but having oneplus device was my dream & i am not disappointed at all....i am using oneplus 9R from past two days & it gets warm while Playing BGMI but i don't mind coz i  was hardcore Mi user so heating is kind of usual thing to me..... but seriously i was so satisfied when i baught 1st Mi device which was MI3 & after that none of the device does the job not even close.... but After using one plus 9R i had that same feeling i am so happy to purchase this phone..... display,camera, processor,ram management & especially OS everything is perfect for me atleast....overall is a very good device.....& now i understand why Oneplus devices are costlier than many other devices"
232,Rohan,"Good Buy ,Impressive looks and Performance.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been Oneplus customer for last 4 years. I had Oneplus 3T previously.Here is what i will rate the phoneLooks - 9/10Perfomance : 9/10Battery : 6 /10Camera : 7/10Features : 9/10Value for Money : 8/10The battery drains quickly if the refresh rate is set to 120hz. If its reduced to 60 hz ,the battery performance increases and even i feel there is no heating issue.I feel the phone is Good buy and can be consider if you are average user not luking for gaming phone.Camera is average."
233,Karan,Poorly Made Phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a bad phone. It definitely does not worth 40k. 25K is more than enough for this.What are we getting in this phone. It just the great software experience. I say, the experience provided by this Oxygen OS is top notch. Someone may prefer this even above iPhone. Such a great software if offers. And screen, you will be amazed and would want to look at it frequently.But then there is nothing. Camera is really poor. I don't know wether this problem is just there with my unit or it's for all but it's there. Even 7T camera is performing better than this. Selfies, colours just seems washed out.Concerning heating issues. It's definitely an over heating device. Even in normal use you will feel that it's warm. I have compared it with some other phone and I observed, even some cheaper phones in the range of 20k are staying cool but this ü§Øü•µThen OnePlus is known for that fast app opening speed. I have experienced it my OnePlus 6, 7T but I don't see it here. Everything feels so slow. I feel I am using a mediocre phone not made by OnePlus.Then there are some bugs.1. Even after selecting preferred calling sim number, it keep on asking it again and again.2. Bluetooth turns on automatically I don't know how.3. Scrolling hangs sometime.4. Screen lock while keeping phone near ear it not great.5. Battery consumption is irregular. Overnight it falls 40% when hotspot is on, sometimes it falls 2%. Logically speaking, on battery saver mode it should not fall more than the time when hotspot was on, but I have seen it falling 10% here.  That's weird.I don't know whether it is just there with my unit or it's for all but I have experienced above problems by carefully observing it.I have applied for replacement of this device. Will update this review if these problems pertain or go away."
234,PULAK KUMAR SAHA,Buying oneplus is worth in 2021 with all the features ensured go and buy it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is good as I had expected but the battery life isn't that much great level. But the performance is top notch, i couldn't see any lag or stuture. But when i used it for the first time i could see some heating issue, with this. But it doesn't matters, it automatically cools down. The display really catches the eye, i streamed a lot of web series and movies in it and i really enjoyed, and the best part is the oxygen os, this is one of the best os experience. Overall, it is worth. Go and buy it if your budget is 40k. It is the best smartphone in this range, giving all the best experiences.Buying oneplus 9R is worth camera quality is also good as i had expected in this price range, the night shots are not that good but its recognizable, day light shots are awesome, i couldn't test it properly as its Lockdown, but i had uploaded some. Display is good as its claimed by the brand."
235,Chetan Sorate,Premium Experience,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera. PERFORMANCE. Look.Only one word ""Awesome""Highly recommended.Only one this front camera is not as expected but not too bad also avarge.First time purchase one plus device after 3 days of uses experience was Good."
236,ds rathore,So so,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is good. Company should had pri install some good health tracking apps too like vivo. Secondly it's gaming phone so one plus must had given us some pri installed games.The most important thing the camera quality is not up to mark and snaps cliked is some time worse specialy in low light. No doubt battery charges in approx 40 min but it drains very fast too. Lastly I was using vivo v11 pro which is best phone as ever I used. While spending 44000 looks unjustified. It was better if I would had bought vivo upgraded verson or apple.
237,AMAZON USER,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  disappointed with oneplus.PROS :Warp 65 charging is fast,Display,CONS :Mobile Heating issue,No auto call record option,Battery drains fast, mobile has to be charged twice in a day,Camera is not up to mark,Very often phone doesnt respond to gestures,BOTTOM LINE: OP 9R is a FLOP SERIES, THINK THRICE B4 U BUY."

239,Ganesh S,Worst Product from Oneplus I think this series itself,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst phone from Oneplus, this is the 1st time I am upset about OP, because there is lots of problems in this phone like, camera not upto it's performance, network issues, when new notification comes and you try to drop down the screen hangs, the music speakers are not good, the only good thing is wrap charging. Rest all its waste of money, not value for money. Very upset."
240,Akhi,Good phone by oneplus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros :1. Screen Quality with 120HZ.2. Screen Size.3. Low Weight.4. SD870 is superfast for daily usage.5. Fingerprint Reader is Superfast.6. Superfast Charging.Cons:1. Battery backup is average You can easily get 6 Hours of SOT in 60Hz & if you use it in 120Hz you may get around 5-5.30 Hours of SOT. But with 65W warp charge you can get a days juice in just 20 Mins.2. Face Unlock is bit slow & sometimes very late in night or in dark conditions.3. Vibration Near back camera while talking in speaker or listening to music in full volume (Seems all 9R devices hv this prob.)4. While going out and playing heavy games like COD, BGMI & Genshin impact it gets warm near camera area but inside room & fan or cooler is ON it doesn't (Warm not heat).5. cameras are not upto mark as many others under 40k provides better camera sensors but overall you can get decent pictures not very Good.6. They do provide a Non PD charger. Last years 8T comes with PD Charger in the Box but Not 9R even 9 & 9Pro comes with PD charger.7. Price seems higher as Iqoo7Legend Costs less thn Op9R, 7Legend comes with SD888."

243,Amazon Customer,Good phone but not the Best,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm a big fan of oneplus phone Till now I have used oneplus 5 and 6t these both phones are the one of best phones in oneplus. Recently I purchased the one plus 9R 12GB RAM and 235 GB storage phone according to me The phone processor, Display are good charger 65w is really Awesome charging the phone in 30 mintues OnePlus Prove it againBut little more drawbacks are thereThe phone heats up lot when I installed the pre-installed  apps in this device but after that I didn't find any heatCamera is not upto mark if oneplus provide an update for camera that it is very useful. If you are a camera lover don't prefer this modelFace recognition is not good sometime it taking time to recognise otherthan that it is okIf you are Oneplus lover you can go for it."
244,John Francis,"Its a good phone. It ""had"" the potential to be a great phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,  Its a nice phonePros1. Its butter smooth. Like it's insanely fast.2. Excellent display. 120 hz - HDR support etc.3. Warp charge is mind-blowing. 30 mins to charge is crazy fast.Cons1. Battery life is sad.2. Camera is really sad. I'm not sure if the issue is because of the hardware. But the software ruins the photos even more. It just overexpose every single photo. Night mode is horrible. The weird part is I get better results while taking photos through instagram and snapchat. The only plus point is the pro mode.3. OTA support from OnePlus has fallen over the years. And there next to negligible improvements in the updates. Infact it makes the phone more unstable.
245,Esha Biswas,Worst camera and heats up a lot.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera is very bad . Otherwise the features are good along with the performance but heating issues are there . The device heats alot quite often and don't dare to use the device without a case, you'll end up getting the back glass scratched . The 'oneplus' is not the same brand we used to know , it has changed a lot .Go for other brand."
246,Suman B.,Nice product overall good.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is excellent.camera is good.i am using Google camera which is very much effective in one plus.use hd and enhance mode to get clear shots.as I am using Snapdragon from a long time,I am used to with this heating.same prb with sd processor..this phone is having little heating and battery drainage issue."
247,Shivam Singh,A typical OnePlus device,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good product. I wish I could give it a 4.5 because it's definitely better than 4 stars but not perfect.Cons-It gets warm (not hot) while charging, playing games.-cameras are definitely not the very best out there but it's quite good.-not much option with wallpapers.-face unlock works even when I am wearing mask, now I don't know whether it is a pro or a con.Pros-phone feels very fast and snappy-very good display-fingerprint scanner is fast-case that is included in the box is of very good quality-the best thing about this device is the speed at which it charges. I am coming from a samsung phone which took 2.5-3hours to charge fully whereas I just plug this device for 10 15mins for 3 times a day and it give me enough charge. Charges at more than 2%/min.-games run smoothly.-vibration motor is very good-very loud speakers.-phone looks very stylish"
248,Darshan,OnePlus 9R Rocks,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing review after using it for 3 days. I'm not seeing any heating issue while charging or using the phone. But I observed that only during first charge and after which I updated the phone may be that resolved the issue. Need to charge my phone twice a day, but that's not a big deal. True flagship in this range. Thanks Amazon and OnePlus:-)"
249,Mohit Nirwan,Super smooth user experience with 120Hz Amoled Screen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  What i liked:1) Super Fast Charging2) Pretty Good Camera3) Super Smooth Screen4) Overall look and grip of the phoneWhat i disliked:1) Battery drains very fast2) Some of the apps like youtube, amazon prime , subways surfers are not able to run in 120Hz screen mode.(I hope it could be fixed ASAP by software update)In conclusion, it a good and value for money phone, much better than OnePlus 9 in case of value for money, go for it."
250,KindleWorm,Always dream for One Plus,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Jumping from OnePlus 3 to OnePlus 9 R. Actually excited.Writing it after using for 2 weeks.Plus:Oxygen 11.. slides so smooth.. no bloatware.Playing lots of games by casting to tv. Excellent performance. Battery stays till night.Awesome display super bright. HDR10 videos feel like real.Charges in less than an hourSuper-fast face recognition. On-screen fingerprint scanner is fast too.No heating issues even when playing games.Got back cover in the box so super happy.Cons:Camera is very bad for this price even in daylight selfie pics are very bad.Miss the 3.0 headphone sockets.Could surely cost little less.Conclusion: one of the best phones for gaming. There are multiple options at lesser price tags but if you want a customized Android experience must go brand.
251,Manas Das,The best OnePlus money can buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Truth to be told that, it's the best OnePlus device I ever used.There's no heating issue so far.Charging is too fast like 20 min of charge can last you an entire day.Camera is Ok... At night it struggles but in the day time it's amazing.The most amazing thing about this device is the hepatic feedback and the sound quality.

IMPORTANT it supports only 2 5g bands(you can check OnePlus tweets for more info)..Good phone for editing because it has good colour views to the screen..If your budget is under 38k go for it,u can get it in less than 35k check offers you won't regret!!!"

258,Aravind Reddy,OS Heating,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus 9R is branded well built smartphone. First of all OS is highest attraction smooth pure+ android experience with well customisation performance display camera charging and drained everything pretty much good still heat management is a biggest flaw. For normal insta use also i felt warmth to my fingers on display and backside not at battry but at cpu chip. Thermals is not upto expectations , i didn't even play a game Still i got around 45-47 battry around 41-43. It may fix through update (maybe). Overall 40k not worthy based on my personal experience."
259,Amazon Customer,Excellent mobile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all Thanks Amazon for fast delivery üöö. Now it's time to come to 1 plus. This is first one plus mobile. I am shifted from Samsung lover to one plus. I can say.one plus is very good in terms of battery, software, storage, camera, performance and etc. Yes it is heating while you continuously working on it. I have faced it and it happened as I obviously I was shifting 10k pictures n videosüòÅ.My experience with one plus is very good at least it is not hanging like samsung which is best thing in this mobile.And if mobile is heating after 3hours of usage I guess its normal. It is machine we can expect such thing sometime."
260,Hari Gopal,Failed the expectation,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Performance is slightly poor than the older version ( 8T , 7T , 6T )If you are using 6T , you will find this phone as bit large and wont like it .Battery charge and durability is very good .Camera is 7/10 , as i am not interested in camera or selfies or photos - didn't explored much on it . But not up to the mark as samsung high series cameras .Dolby effect is goodspeakers are good .But overall usage performance is  missing something that has in the lower versions.If you are willing to buy 9 series , go with onepus 9 . oneplus 9R is not up to the mark ."

Better than Oneplus 9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good battery, lasts about a day .Camera quality is very good although not best in class.Display is bright smooth and has good colours. Stereo speakers greatly improve video experience.One thing about the camera Is that Ultrawide night shots are not that good..although overall nightscape photos are good enoughMOST OF THE BATTERY PROBLEMS AND HEATING ISSUES WERE FIXED IN A UPDATE THAT I RECEIVED THE DAY AFTER I RECEIVED THE SMARTPHONE...Without the update the battery drains faster and heating issues may persist... But after the update all problems have been solved.Not to mention Software experience is just too good after I switched from Vivo smartphone. No stutters at all and no frame drops... Can run all games at max settings too"
267,Dhaval,Very Poor Phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Very Poor Performance against pricing.Do not buy.Very costly again features.No unique feature for this phone.
268,Ciddu Rathnakar,High recommended. The best premium screen glass you could evr get.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Absolutely loved the product, i have been using opentech products from long while and they provide best quality product. I have compared with spigen too you dont feel the difference. The package and off sales support is top notch. These ppl are honest. Where els in Amazon buy get lot of cheap products."
269,Subhendu Pattanaik,"Great device, but with unique cons!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing Device, but comes with it own pros and cons.Pros -1 ) Great software experience with many options to customize.2 ) Blazing fast while browsing and day to day usage.3 ) 120 HZ on this panel feels buttery smooth.4 ) Fast Charging - 0 to 100 in 40 minutes. 0 to 50 in 20 minutes.5 ) 6.30 - 7 hours of SOT.Cons1) Better than average camera. Nothing special considering the price. You can use G cam or pro mode to get the best though.2) Major heating Issues while playing games like Genshin Impact , COD mobile or Pubg in highest setting. ( Since it's marketed as a""gaming phone"" )3) Sometimes heats up with video watching or rendering."
270,kavitha,Worst gallery !,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the phone but the Gallery was very worst , I bought 12GB RAM means its processor fast but in gallery pictures loading slowly , deleting slowly some are missing for sometime , I never expected this one my old phone OnePlus 6T better than this !"
271,Anonymous,OnePlus is now Oppo,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Upgraded from OnePlus 7t and regretted the decision so much that I had to change to iPhone.Battery back up is good.Camera is very bad and most times it doesn‚Äôt even focus on the subject properly.Phone UI is good and fast.Often the phone heats up even with small tasks.Overall the phone is not worth 40k128 gb variant is good enough if considering.
272,Amazon Customer,Genuine Review,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Genuine Review after using two months-Overall phone is good. But I am facing problem with wifi connection. Many times it show no internet while on other device internet work well.Before this, i was using iphone 6. So camera quality is average. It do not show the original colour like iPhone 6.And now OnePlus is no longer independent. It merged with Oppo. So soon it will lose their customers. I am genuinely saying, OnePlus will definitely disapper from the market."

  ¬†I never accept this kind of Defects from Oneplus Brand. There are many defects like camera is automatically going to close every time. Heating issue in normal conditions. App errors during normal conditions. Screen is also flickering.Check this video"
274,satheeshviki,Don't go for online purchase at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It was my bad to buy this mobile through Amazon. It was started heating from the moment it was booted up. By then it was heating while charging and using hotspot option on the phone. We raised a complaint with Amazon and they said they will replace the phone within 3 days however we are running behind them to get the new or replacement product delivered to us. Today we are on 4th day till now no clue when we will get our phone delivered to us. Pathetic service by Amazon. Worst.

277,M.Hari,Satisfied switched from iphone 11 and no regrets,4.0 out of 5 stars,  As usual oneplus value for money especially IMO 9r is better than 9 and matte black version which is carbon black one is an eye killer super premium in mid range price vivo x60 may appear a close competition but oneplus have unique device so updates and oxygen os is looks far premium than vivo's even though they all are sub brands of single company any smart buy guys
278,Harpreet Singh,Worth purchasing !!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Upgrading from oppo F3 and using this device from last 4-5 days. Here is my overall experience and what I conclude about the phone :1. Build quality and looks - 5/52. Display - 5/53. Performace & OS - 5/54. Fromt Camera - 2/5 ( Its really very poor )5. Rear camera - 4/56. Battery life - 4.5/57 Charging speed - 6/5So if you're a camera cantric person then you should think before purchsing this phone. Other than that, this phone is a beast."
279,Ankit,Most logical one in entire 9 series,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Switched over from op6...first thing to notice is screen.. immediately u can feel the difference...although i would have loved if it had 3.5 mm jack however i guess giving it a miss is a norm today..charging as usual is super fast...regarding heating..because sides are metal they tend to get warm but nothing alarming...performance wise no issues..everyday usage is a delight and yes games are awesome to play..but yes battery life is probably same as op6 inspite of 9r having bigger battery...hopefully this will be fixed via an ota update...overall an excellent phone and value for money...
280,Bharath Kumar.I,Great performance!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  A good device from OnePlus..Many of them complaining about heating issues and battery life.Trust me, battery life was above averagecamera also above averageIm getting good battery backup by switching into 60hz from 120hz. Switching to 60hz didn't affect performance. Camera was good in lightening conditions.. colors were rich and good.Fingerprint sensor works perfectly finePreviously i used Redmi note 7 pro.First time using oxygen os. Its super smooth and fluidHaptic feedback was rich and at flagship levelIf u really need good battery backup, turn off haptic feedback, always on display and convert into 60hz"
281,Rajat Mohanty,Breast for the asking price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros:1. Excellent premium build quality2. Loud and bass heavy stereo speakers3. Good battery life with 120Hz refresh rate4. Good network reception and call quality5. Video recording capabilities are of next levelCons:1. Low light camera performance could be better.2. Contrast heavy photos don't look good at all time
282,Troy Moses,A really great device with the only let down being the camera.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Rigorously used the device for the whole day with no overheating issues. It does get slightly warm when gaming and charging which is normal I guess. Would have given the device a full 5star rating, but for the Camera. The image on the camera app before capturing looks way better than what is actually captured, the cyberpunk filter is just a gimmick, and the nightscape is just pathetic. If the camera is not a big deal for you, I would definitely suggest this phone.OnePlus, please tend to the camera issues. Expecting the camera software to enhance over time by updates. üëç"

286,Anand Dosani,Overall a very nice phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you want performance, excellent display, good battery backup and incredibly fast charge along with decent look then it is the best choice. The only thing that lacks in here is the camera quality. Oxygen OS is great too."
287,nandhagopal yadav,Awesome Flagship Rig,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome speed... Easy in switching apps.Gaming mode is very flexi for multitasking and no heating issues.Charging heats a bit but coolsdown in a while. Camera is better with raw images. Oxygen os provides flawless animations.4k is just wow to watch. Ultra HD for pubg is lag free with 5g.Fingerprint reader is very fast n accurate.Battery is powerful too. Worth a buy... If heating often then you gotta return the phone n exchange a new one... Coz it doesn't get heated up much.

Performance wise it's good, in real time we won't notice any lags or delay. I guess this is the best OnePlus 9 series phone launched. Camera wise I guess colors are very punchy, in few extreme conditions I have noticed dark orange color was coming as dark red. Bokeh effect is fine with ultra wide camera. For 40k this is amazing."
309,Gopinathan Palani,Suggest to buy......,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very good phone. This is the first time I'm using this. Very good processor, touching sampling, in display fringer print sensors, etc. I'm sad of battery, in this we have only 4500 mah it is okay for one day usage with 120hz display function, camera is good they have to improve more. Other than this I suggest to buy this product. Multitasking are awesome, gaming experience was so good. I'll give 5/5 but considering the battery I'll give only 4.5/5.Awesome......"

I have faced heating problem but after 1 day it does not heat that much, if you can compromise camera quality then you can definitely go for it, if you want better camera and performance then go fo IQOO7 OR OTHER PHONES, i forgot to mention it's video quality, it has the best stability in video recording and the quality of video is way better than IQOO7"

The experience is what you get when you hold it on your hand, no photo or video can get you that. Loved the Device, Everything is upto the mark and buttery smooth performance. Camera is also very good, I think Youtubers try to comapre it with their DSLRs, Lol, But everyday use, you will not even see any difference. The Phone is Best at its Price.Never Settle"
319,Fir3EagL3,Battery Life,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Edit : Received a update today for battery optimization. Will update after few days.Battery is draining too fast. From 100 % it comes down to less than 40% when using 120 hz display for minimal works like checking whatsapp and all.While using 60 hz it comes down to 50% till evening.A bit dissatisfied with the battery life. Whereas my old Vivo V15 pro remains at 67 % till the time I reach home while using it for minimal works like whatsapp and chrome.

327,nithin,Fast charge is like crazy good. 120hz refresh rate is good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Been using it for more than a week. Didn't find any issues at first but I felt battery drained a little quicker and there definitely is a heating issue... not the solid smartphone I expected OnePlus to provide us with at a high price... Pretty sure this is better than the other overpriced 9 series phones.
328,prakashvarma,Value for Money Except Camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A perfect balance in everything except the camera quality. I am a heavy user and a long-term Samsung User I usually don't like Oneplus.

342,vishal lavania,Slightly overpriced according to the specifications.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Face recognition sometimes works even when the object is 1 to 1.5 ft apart which I feel is not good from security perspective.Fingerprint sensor is Swift but shows error  sometimes even after pressing the button accurately.Sound quality is good. Screen quality is good.Performance is good.Camera needs to be improved for this price range.Moreover I feel this device deserves a price of less than 35k with the given features.
343,Balanagu Sailaja,Value for money is ok ok,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a good choice for a casual mobile user. It is very comfortable to use, and for good gaming. There are some issues with some apps which I have complainted in the OnePlus community,btw the cost of the phone is lot lot higher for features which there in the phones which are below 35000 but this phone is 45000 for no outstanding features other than it OS"

Its just above mid range cameras not flagship level..I have not issue in battery life....tillpicture on picture has some issues.. like youtube Premium and Netflix.....might fix in software.For this price i could only find this phone great.. Because of the software experience... I rate it to top of the android overlays..use a cover back tends to scratch soon..
346,Rishabh GUPTA,Didn't meet my expectations,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I am a bit disappointed in it.....camera quality not so good but okay....screen quality is too good.... battery life is also considerable....but the main issue is its low light face detection...i am just shocked that this phone can't even detect your face in low light while unlocking the phone whereas my poco f1 can detect face in low light even after being 2.5 years old.....anyway overall good phone...but not able to meet my expectations....

348,Pradeep gollapalli ,Issues with Oneplus 9R,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after using more than 1 month, am very dissatisfied with this product.  This is my second phone. My first was having over heating problem then I got it replaced with new device. This second device also having some technical issues. Suddenly my phone got stuck and not able to unlock the phone, so I had to do factory reset and lost all my data. The experience with Oneplus  9R is a big disaster...."

351,bhanu yadav,Worst phone ever. Not worth the pricetag,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life worst. Call recording feature not okay. When we call anyone we have to press button of call recorder when call is picked up. The person on the other line also gets notification that call is being recorded. Other One Plus versions are not having these stereotypes.
352,abhishek verma,Except camera and heating issue it's truly flagship phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have a mixed feelings with OnePlus 9R.sometimes it feels like a true flagship like heaven and then the overheat isssue just let me down to earth. Camera is not expected. Also why there is no adaptive refresh for the screen. For me when a user pour this amount in any of the smartphone they must get some values in it. But overall display is good battery performance is good as per 4500mah. So please think before try to buy this.
353,Sonu,Overall okay okay product. Comparing to 9R my previous OnePlus5 was much better.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader - 4/5Battery - 4/5 It drains quicklyCamera quality - Front camera can be improved. In Rear camera, before clicking photo everytime you need to select between 12mp and 48mp, which irritates."

358,krishna,Heatsup abnormally,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone looks good. Display is also nice. But it has serious heating issues. It heatsup abnormally while charging. Camera performance is below average. Redmi 10's camera is much better. Selfie pictures come with a slight red tint. Oneplus need to work on these cons to keep it's reputation.
359,Vijay Patil,Nce1,5.0 out of 5 stars,  All Are Gd But Price Should Be 35 to 40 I think ...now all nobles come from this features so ...if u r an OnePlus fan go for it without any doubt

I have been using @120 hz and sot Is around 8 hrs.. I use a lot of yt, browsing and social media apps. I don't game so sot may vary accordingly.No heating issues what so ever even when charging!"
362,Amazon Customer,Not worth for 43k,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not satisfied with this phone i was using one plus 6 for past 3 years thats far better than one 9rIssues1) slow charge compared to one plus 62 touch response is not great3) finger senser slow4) hangs some time5) network issue( I have other phone oppo samesime network i get full tower )Even after spending 43k my it's not even meeting my old phone performance
363,Akshay p.,Not worth it to buy expectations not met about battery life,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Expected much better OnePlus series phone but not worth it to buy. Phone is heating even we are using data and hotspot for a while.Battery life is less if use is heavy but we have to charge is again again charging is fast arount 30-35min full charge.Camera is basic like 8T only. I'll recoomend go with higher version of OnePlus 9pro instead 9R. Hasselblad not provided
364,Mayur Parmar ,Very decent product. Value for money. Happy to be the member of One Plus.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Fingerprint reader is too smooth.Battery life is good.Camera quality is excellent.

366,Hardeep Singh,Best phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus need to improve the camera quality but in performance this is the best phone,"
367,Ab,Excellent phone for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is an excellent device overall. There is no questioning the speed of this deivce as this is an op device and runs on oxygen os. Tech reviewers on youtube may critisize the phone for its camera but it works pretty fine for me.If you are into professional photography and all then also you would get satisfactory results for the range this lies in. You cant expect results such as Note20.
368,Devendra Kumar Mishra,Very good pH price might little less..but it's good ph,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Product is good but dislike is for Amazon service they are offering no cost emi but when bank bill generated they added gst and tax separately then where comes no cost emi...Amazon should have clearly mentioned about this....that bank will charge such charges....
369,Harsh kashyap,It's an OnePlus flagship with an decent camera.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  No heating issues while gaming infact it remains cooler then any Snapdragon 888 phones even from OP 9 pro and rog 5 . It does get slightly warm while charging @warp charge 65 but warmness is similar to warp charge 30T. It's an flagship in every but in  camara , it's decent . it's nothing like iPhone or S20's but good . But as a user camara can be improved by just installing Google camera app"

371,Aishwarya C.,"The camera sucks, you're better off with your old phone",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera quality is worse than the one I had before this (OnePlus 6). It's horrendous. It'll make you want to smack your phone and that's when I wasn't even expecting an excellent camera. What a waste. Everything else is practically the same. You get a good battery backup, it's smooth and all that but so were the previous phones. I wouldn't recommend OnePlus 9r at all."
372,Amazon Customer,"Good Performance & Responsive Touch, but Camera not upto the mark !!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a good performance phone. Excellent Performance, no lag or heating issues. Speaker is good. Battery stays for 1 full day. Fast charging, Takes around 45 mins for full charge. Good Responsive touch.No Aux in. Apart from Main Camera, all other cameras quality is poor. 2MP camera is a absolute waste !!Definitely not worth for 40K, should be priced around 35K."

Battery life is not as bad I listened. Slightly warm up while charging may be due to 65W fast Charging.No heating issues found. Camera is not bad. 48MP main camera performs very well. Mostly, I liked the stereo speaker quality very loud and in-display fingerprint scanner very fast. As you know OxygenOS is very smooth."
377,Alok,Not bad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well this is my first OnePlus and overall my experience after using for 1 month is not bad. Camera quality could had been good. BUILD QUALITY is average.

  ¬†Consider before buying this product, from the beginning of setting up the device it started heating up a lot( lot means the camera said high temperature camera cannot function) i thought its okay but even after that for mild usage too the device heated up remembers me of my first xiaomi device redmi note 5 proBut i was not expecting same kind of heating issue in such so said premium phone Really disappointed.And maybe due to the heating the battery drains out quickly thats very bad impression and charging too takes about 1 hour from 0-100 and not the described 40 minsI cant able to find any other reviews anywhere in the platform or website regarding one plus 9r, and i think something fishy about thisAnd performance wise too gaming drops frame due to heatingAnd dont even think of using this device under sun.Maybe ive got a defective peice it seems others kindly submit your view"
2314,Sanjay Madhivanan,VFM product by OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First time OnePlus user. This phone never disappoints me. Performance is lit.Camera is above average but I hope OnePlus fixes them with a proper updates.So far never noticed any bugs.Battery backup is good.Charging speed is phenomenal.Bought 8GB/ 128Gb variant.5G bands in this phone is disappointing but I heard that onplus will give updates on existing 5G bands in the OTA update.Bought this device by OnePlus official site on 25th of May.Don't go for negative reviews. This is recommended for all types of users (gamers, and day to day usages)."
2315,Viky,I will rate it an Average product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  My own experience after using for 20 days.This mobile is Good for those person:1. Play Game once or twice in a day2. Watch videos on youtube or other very less3. The battery backup is decent if you use phone for calling, checking messages, emails, social media check. It will give you one day backup.PRO.1. Premium look and beautiful design2. Up to mark camera3. Screen resolution and picture view quality is fair4. sound quality is good.5. UI and OS are simplified and fair.6. Faster processor among same segment mobiles.7. Nice on screen finger print location easy to use.8. More customization options in settings.9. Fast charging is amazing. Full charge from 0% to 100% in less than 30 minutes.Cons.1. Heat while charging, playing game for 5 minutes, watching movies, using camera, video recording.2. No side bar gesture and lack some basic gestures3. Face Lock is not much secure4. Battery is decent but drain fast as compared to other mobile.5. Unwanted preinstalled application that are unable to delete (netflix and more but there is option of disabling although these applications will eat storage)6. For 128GB varients 15 GB is reserved for system7. For gamers they have to charge mobile regularly."
2316,Subham,Oneplus 9R > Oneplus 9;,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you want to spend 30k extra for a sexy screen & camera then buy a Oneplus 9 pro.But if u ask, between Oneplus 9 vs Oneplus 9R, Oneplus 9R is a no brainer.Reasons:1. Processors 870 vs 888, same thing yaar. 870 is enough for you trust me.2. Display same- 120 Htz panel in both3. Built quality Oneplus 9R is better (no kidding- it has metal frame while Oneplus 9 has plastic)4. OS: Both has the buttery smooth Oneplus oxygen OS5. Charging: 65 watt crazzyy fast charging.4. Camera: 9R has normal camera and 9 has hassel whoknows blad camera.Well if you want to put 10k Hasselblad branding, go ahead buy Oneplus 9. I would rather save this 10k and buy 7 shares of HDFC Bank LTD. You will be a richer person than today 5 years down the line. I promise. Or buy a good set of wireless headphones.

Its been just one day and I am totally in love with the UI and swift touch. I upgraded my fone from samsung a50 to one plus 9R and I must say that I do not regret the fact that I chose one plus over samsung.To those people who only want a good camera fone, they do not play heavy games and stuff..and who's just wanna buy for its camera.  I think this is a big yes.."

2321,Rishi kumar,Very good budget smartphone form OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am writing down this after using it for 1 month. I got the blue one with 8GB RAM. Overall the device is good, and honestly, it is one plus 8T at a lower priceI will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish the setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen-to-body ratio is good.Cons -1. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.2. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for a few.3. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have."
2322,shyam,Quality issue in 9r,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus is not the same one plus before.They are settling with never settle tag in one plus 9 series.I bought and replaced, finally amazon refunded the money.9r have severe quality issue in making and the quality of camera is pathetic.Oxygen OS is still great.i think 8t is still better than 9r or go with Nord."
2323,abhishek chaurasia,VERY BAD EXPERIENCE/Need to know while Exchanging OLD phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Technical error in amazon app while doing Exchange Run Verification in exchanged phone. The code provided by the delivery agent is not applied in app for verification. It happens simultaneously 2 days and the supervisor of agent and amazon customer service Can't help it too. By the result of it I Can't get my NEW PHONE and it is taken back by agent.amazon you need to correct this.1 - Run verification is done only in exchanged phone ? why2 - If your app is not able to verify then you need to verify it manually and get the job done.When all the details are provided by me before placing the order then why it is so hectic rules that the verification is done only on app which is installed in only on exchanged phone. Really a bad experience for me and cannot expect this from amazon. highly dissatisfied.Final result - nobody is happy2 times delivery agent comes within 2 days, your code given to agent is not working.As a customer I can't get my new phone just because of the verification is not happening.Even customer service can't help me.more of that the reason is given by agent is that the details given by the customer didn't match so cannot be able to deliver the package."
2324,VENKAT E,Amazon have to pay the compensation if the mistake is from there side.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Why amazon won't pay the compensation to customers, if the mistake is from there side.Worst amazon service. This is how amazon is looting customers. If something went wrong from customer side, we have to pay.  But something went wrong from amazon customer have to adjust for that. Why amazon won't pay the compensation to customer, if mistake is from there side."
2325,Jayadratha Mondal,Recommended if camera is not that much in priority,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a practical phone.If you want a performance loaded phone with a clean UI then it can be a right choice, but remember the following.1. Fingerprint is a bit slower.2. Camera is worst. A 15k phone also gives same quality photo.3. Only one 5G band."
2326,Jeswin John,OnePlus 100%,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this phone from oneplus store. I am writing this review after 2 weeks. Like all  of you I also research a lot about buying a new phone that cost such a high amount. The phones which I used previously was mainly Samsung phones. Samsung phones were good but I decided to change to a flagship phone now. The options I had were Samsung S20 FE 5G oneplus 9R and iPhone 11. AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH I GOT ONE PLUS 9R. This phone has a very good display at 120 Hz refresh rate. Call quality and signal reception are very good. Screen on time more than 8 hours with a lot of YouTube  and browsing and calling and some amount of game (less than 1 hour of FIFA Mobile). And oxygen OS experience is very smooth (I will never go back to phone with ads and bloatware in UI). The only thing I found bad was the camera quality. it is not as good as Samsung phones. And another thing the charging is very fast it only takes around 30 minutes for full charge ( 15 to 100).It has very good build quality also. I never regret spending 40k on this phone. That's how good it is. And you can get OnePlus buds Z for only 1000rs  with 9R if you buy this phone from oneplus store.
2327,PERSIAL D.,Fast Delivery and Great Quality Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received Oneplus 9R with some defect, i.e., a small dust particle inside the screen guard (not able to remove). So, I request for replacement since I have invested more for this device. And the seller didn't contact me, not even require any photograph or screenshot for the defect and not even call. But they just delivered a new Oneplus 9R device without any defect this time. Great experience. Thanks to the SELLER and AMAZON AGENTS (whoever worked for this). 100% satisfied. Once again Amazon proved that it is a great online shopping app with this kind of Great Sellers.This mobile is running butter smooth with Oxygen OS. Camera quality as expected. Battery backup is great. Some of the buyers are claiming the heating issue, but I never faced any heating issue till now. However all the mobiles will get heat while charging. But I didn't feel any heating issue while using the mobile phone. I received a software update when I configure my mobile for the first time. I need fast response and stock like feel without any bloatware apps and ads. And thatswhy I choose Oneplus device. I am satisfied with my money spent with this Great Seller."
2328,Gibran Khan,Probably the last oneplus Flagship Killer!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The best phone out there practically speaking.I went for 9r over the 9pro despite having the budget for 9pro as the 9r is more value for money (did not even look at oneplus 9).Excellent battery lifeSuper fast stable chargingNo heating issues at allAmazing displayFlagship built quality ( even better than the more expensive oneplus 9)Definitely go for it!!
2329,BHARATH DK,Flagship is searching for the flag now! With its blend Camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus has lost its independence of camera when it runs for competition. Moving from a winner to a name sake runner.. ideally I get to see the crispness of the one plus 5 far better than the OnePlus 9r camera because back then  I was lykka king when I take the phone out even though the competition was tough by that time.. op 5 was real and op9r tries to be real. One plus u know wat i mean . I do get it the R&D becomes stiffer when u plan for 3nos  Op 9 series at same time and now another Nord 5g on the junk. Ur cloning idea is cool but üëé. One Plus I never give up on you, same way please Try better software runs."
2330,Rams,Mobile is good.Not satisfied with camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall mobile is good. As mentioned by one plus camera not worth for the price.Pros- Superrl touch- good Build quality- Back casing- I can say super charge. Never seen any chareger charging that much speed before.- Camera is good outdoors or when high lighting is there- Excellent sound and screen qualityBAD/Cons:- Very very poor CAM.. too bad  pictures in indoor with regular house lighting and in low lighting. Highly disappointed for that price range.- Charging may not last for full day if you use above average. I used with 50+ apps ( Regular phones should get more than a day)- No audio jac option. Litterally you need to use any bluetooth device
2331,Durga Prasanna Das,Worthy purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I wanted to gift my sister one of these and I was really skeptical as I spend months deciding on buying a new phone and I was pretty sure with my decision to go ahead with the 9R until I saw the comments about heating issue. But I still decided to purchase one and see for myself if that is an issue, and trust me that is not. The device was heating up as soon as we switched it on and doing all necessary switches from old phone to new but once that was done we updated it and rebooted, and used the device for full day consuming media, playing games, using camera and it didn‚Äôt heat even the slightest. The battery life is just unbelievable, put it on charge for 15 minutes and you‚Äôre full day ready! And yes the camera when compared to the likes of Apple & Pixel is subpar but otherwise it‚Äôs really just a matter of what looks good to your eyes, they‚Äôre good enough to be uploaded on Instagram. The screen quality is just amazing and the sound is also great! And people complaining about the OS, it‚Äôs still smooth af!"
2332,Arun Das K,Satisfied...!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Been using this phone for the last 20 days. I'm completely satisfied with the performance. I got what I expected from a oneplus device. Yes cameras are not something extraordinary but it's okay for my kind of usage. OnePlus is never known for their cameras. Hardware is capable of taking good pictues, I believe a little bit of tweaking in image processing will definitely improve image quality.Pros:-* Performance, performance and performance. Sd 870 is blazingly fast.* Oxygen OS* Stereo speakers* 65W charging and battery backup* Brand value and resale valueCons:-* Mediocre cameras* Single 5g band"
2333,A.R,Your true companion!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone since a week and what I found interesting is...1)The 65w charger which charges the phone from 1% to 100% in 42 mins.2) It's display is awesome and it feels great on hand especially with the lake blue colour.Didn't found any heating issue uptil now.3)Can say the phone is a bit over priced as it could be a big deal if it came under 35k. But still gives you a premium feel.4) Coming on to camera performances. There had been many negative reviews.But what I felt is the camera performance of the phone is decent and at daylight it really captured pretty much impressive photos.Yes, it lags a bit in low light condition.But that's not an issue. People are never satisfied with what they get. Even if they get hasselblad cameras they would still complain.We never get a perfect phone there are some or the other flaws in every phones.So if you have a budget of 40k you can go with it.This phone has everything with it. It won't disappoint you.Also you can always trust one plus brand!!"
2334,Abhas,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome phone, I switched from iphone to OnePlus and don't regret it, haven't faced any heating issue at all during usage over a month.. Camera leaves a bit to be desired though, it's decent but color enhancement by the phone specially with selfies doesn't look very good, but my camera usage is limited so I can live with that."
2335,Siddharth,Not worth the price for a Non-5G phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dont let the advertising fool you.This is Not a 5G phone.As stated on the website. This suppports Band 41 and band 78 in India.To put things in perspective.. depending on the auction of 5G spectram. This phone *might* work with 1 operator.One plus outright mislead the public by saying more 5G bands will be supported by an OTA update. They later apologized for this ""miscommunication"". Only after  1000s of units of the phone were sold.So if you are looking for a future proof phone.. this is not for you. This phone will be outdated in no more than 18 months."
2336,NitinBK,Battery issues with 9R,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery is an issue with 9R. I have used OnePlus one, 3T, 6T and now 9R. Based on my previous experience, 9R has major battery issues. It takes 45+ minutes to charge the phone and it does not last even 20 hours. With same number of applications and use, 6T was doing much much better. 6T battery used to last more than 24 hours, and 20 minutes for charging."
2337,Aman Saxena,Battery Drain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fast is good but not when it comes to battery drain. I played a game for 8-10 minutes and battery dropped down by 5%. Talked on the call for 22 minutes and battery went down by 7% - 8%.Also, finger print sensor is not that good, you have to put your finger 2-3 times to get it unlocked.Processor is goood enough and very fast but these flaws make the device not a good buy."
2338,Prashant Jamshete,Flop,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Flop..over hype..upto 30k okay.better go vivo x60 one plus is flop mobile phone don't buy at all phones of vivo
2339,Manoj varma,Should you buy this?,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This is extremely decent phone at this price coming to specs everything is absolutely good display- GoodSpeaker- GoodBattery- very GoodPerformance- average not as expected but thanks to the Ram better app loading speedCamera- Bad. At this price compare to other phones not a good optionFinally the only reason to buy it is OxygenOSIf you're person don't care on UI then don't think to purchase this phone there is some best phone to buy infact you can save some money on other phones
2340,Harish,The flagship killer! Go for it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's the perfect phone to upgrade if your budget is around 40k.Like most of us Initially i was in a dielama to go with oneplus9. But the difference between the oneplus9 Indian version and international version made me to realize that it's not the better choise.With no wireless charging,  5g support with only 2 bands , plastic body & heating issues.. I don't think it's worth sending the extra 10k for the 5nm SD888 chipset with a better camera.Having said that 9r is a solid phone it has Really good build quality (Metal frame) , it does feel premium while holding it.I did not see any heating issue in my 2 days of usage. Battery efficiency is OK when you have 120hz as the default refresh rate..Offcourse it is the identical twin of 8t(same spec Inc the cameras), it's really funny that the screen guard or back case of 8t fits perfectly for 9r..Good phone to recommend.. Go for it.. Carbon black is soooo goood!!"
2341,hari Krishna.t,Go for 9 instead of 9r,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  My experience of using OnePlus 9R for more than 4 weeks here are few things one should concentrate if you are looking for a quality phone including processer, display and gaming go for OnePlus 9RConscamera quality didn't meet my expectations bcz if you click a pic and zoom that it didn't meet the OnePlus standards as OnePlus 7pro is better than thisThe phone heats up so quickly taht if I connect to my laptop &use apps like Microsoft teams one day it popped a notification showing that your mobile is overheated which is literally annoyingBattery drains so fastProsMobile built quality is awesome with fullhd+& super amoled screen display ect,120hz screen refresh rate,65watt dast charges my phone in just 37mins from 0 to 100percentOverall I found battery heating & camara quantity as an issue in 9R"
2342,Calvin Nazareth,Reliable and well-built!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone for about a month now, and have no complaints at all.The UI is smooth, no lags noticed anywhere even on maximum settings on all apps. It does heat a bit after some heavy gameplay, but that is usually only after 20-40 minutes depending on the app. The camera is great, and the OIS supports well. It also feels sturdy in the hand, although I would recommend getting the OnePlus sandstone bumper case. It adds to the protection while giving a slightly rock-textured grip. The bundled clear case works well too, but it catches noticeable dirt easily.Overall, great phone all-round!"
2343,Yash Modi,Back side Vibration below the camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I have purchased One Plus 9r from official site. And I am facing vibration problem at the back side  below the camera while playing any music or video. It's very irritating and I have contacted to the one Plus team but they haven't solved my problem.I want to confirm that is this issue occuring with my device or others are also facing this.Other than this the device is superb and I don't faced any heating issues.
2344,Mohit Jain,Intentionally stop and provide buggy softwares after 1 year to force purchase new device.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst company to purchase products from. 2 years old devices - software support stopped! Buggy softwares.They do this intentionally to force us to purchase new devices, just like when apple was caught slowing their older phones down to force people to purchase new ones! Dont go for this.Samsung has promised 3 years software support!"

2347,Amazon Customer,Better Devices Available,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall device is fine but there are better Devices. This one is same as 8T. Eventhough it shows LPDDR5 RAM, actually it is LPDDR4X. IMX586 sensor is 2 year old camera sensor. Also as it's only released in india, don't expect good software support like global devices. Have Returned mine, when I found out about the RAM scam."
2348,Himanshu bhatia,First OnePlus worst OnePlus. Not expected this ü•∫,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased OnePlus 9R Last month, I am very much disappointed by the OnePlus. It was my first OnePlus phone and it seems to be my worst decision.Genuine problems that I am facing1. App doesn't open, blank screen display.2. App closes automatically while working.3. Camera quality is very bad. Blurry photo and night mode is worst.4. Major problem heating issue5. Back camera glass scratches.I wish I could have returned it timely.I would suggest don't go OnePlus 9R. You will realise later on wasting 40000 it's better go for some other brands with lessor price.Amazon team Darshita electronics I request for return and refund."

2350,PUNYASLOK C.,Flagship for the masses ! A true champ !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  To all those people who say phone is heating up , please do acknowledge the fact that it's summers in India with room temp touching above 35 .The processor is a flagship level to those that have upgraded including myself from a sd710 series chip it's obvious that it will heat up more than mid range processors.Phone will be warm but there is not major issues. Upgrading from sd710 to sd 870 ,it's blazing fast.Camera is decent enough ,don't expect iPhone level shots .Performance , multimedia is top notch.Definitely way better than vivo and all as oxygen os is way too smooth."
2351,Jithaaa,Heating issue,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome productbut too much heatingHeats very rapidly...........
2352,Yogesh,Worst phone from OnePlus ever in history,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This is the review of 20 Days of Usage of OnePlus 9r is the Re-branded Of OnePlus 8t .No miror improvement here .I would say worst phone from OnePlus .If your a new user of OnePlus I will suggest you to add some money &  buy Iphone Xr or iPhone 11.Cons of OnePlus 9rWorst camera.Heating problem.Spekaer lags.Phone lags.Prons -Brand Value & Oxygen OsBattery drain.Worst display.Slow performance.
2353,Nishant,Display and performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Using oneplus 9r for last 20 daysIts a great phone but don't worth it at it priceI also have oneplus 8And i have to compareOneplus 8 is much betterEven after 120hz displayOneplus 8 90hz display work way smoothIf i can go back i would definitely buy oneplus 8 or 8tThose are much better as well as cheaper
2354,Abhimanyu Singh,Heating Issue,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone is all over very good but while charging and using camera it heats alot. I wasn't expecting this from one plus when you are paying 40k for a phone you always expect more instead of heating issues. And it's not even a flagship. I mean which flagship phone cost's 40k so if you are thinking it's a flagship no it's not.
2355,Sumanth,Poor...heating issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Extremely disappointed ..I am very medium user of the phone...there is a big heating issue while you are just browsing so cannot think of playing games or watching YouTube videos and battery drain is fast.. camera is ok but I didn't find much difference between Nord and 9r for camera....my biggest mistake is buying the phn before reviews attached
2356,sakansh gupta,"Battery life, Heating up, No phone cases available",3.0 out of 5 stars,  The battery was draining really quickly. Had to change the refresh rate from 120Hz to 60Hz. It's working better now but still not as good as one would have expected for a 4500mAh battery to last.The phone heats up quite a bit while charging but after that it goes back to functioning on a normal temperature.Overall it's a good phone. Not a great one though.And you're gonna find it really difficult to find a good case for the phone. I still haven't been able to. DO NOT go for the cases that say they'll fit both 8T and 9R. They won't fit around the camera module.
2357,Sidd,Worst phone.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  It is the worst phone in this price segment. There are more better phones available at this price segment. If camera is important for you then never look at Oneplus 9R. See how bullry the photo is üò≠üò≠.

2361,Sumit Jain,Look for alternative,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Oneplus 9R is a disappointment. Company advertises to have 48 megapixel but camera doesn't allow you to zoom. When you want to zoom it switches to 12 megapixel. The output is extremely poor. Still if you want to buy the phone, then would suggest to take a hands-on experience at Oneplus experience store before ordering. If you are an old Oneplus user you will be disappointed with 9R."

Been 2 days now. Working absolutely fine. No heating issue whatsoever. Dual speakers are great. Haptics too are surprisingly good. Fast and buttery smooth performance. Camera i hardly use, so no comments. Indeed a Very good phone for the price of 40k. Go ahead. Matte black color looks dope."

2375,Rudra,Please save your 40k,3.0 out of 5 stars,  To be honest expected way more then it offered . Being a previous oneplus 7 phone owner thought 9R would be a great choice. Day by day oneplus phones are getting ridiculous (of courses in pricing too). The very being of oneplus phone is dead i.e. getting security and os updates. It‚Äôs better to go for iphone 11 ( during sale you can get @43k)instead of 9/9R

2543,Siddharth,Reasonable Phone Overall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  12/256 GB model (purchased in May, 2021 for INR 42k):Cons:1) Battery life - a full charge barely lasts a day, for me (I'm a heavy user with the display refresh rate permanently set at 120 Hz).2) Camera - the picture quality from both the cameras - the front and the back - is subpar.3) 5G - the available 5G bands on this device are a sham.4) Back panel vibration - the back panel of the phone does vibrate on higher loudspeaker volumes (but, with a back cover on, I hardly ever notice it anymore).Pros:1) Performance - this phone has never lagged, for me, yet.2) Display - the 120 Hz refresh rate shows and the AMOLED screen is a feast to the eyes.3) Stereo speakers - the loudness and the audio clarity are good.4) Rubbery back panel - the rubberized/silicone covered back Gorilla Glass feels excellent in the hands and also provides for a fantastic grip."
2544,Nibedita,Not a Flagship phone ... Kind of Ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Writing the review after using the phone for a month...The phone is smooth with 120 hz refresh rate.camera quality is okayish. OS is good .. but having problem while opening some apps like Amazon prime music Spotify black lines are coming while opening the app.. Wrap charge is awesome .. need only 30 min to fully charge the phone..  but the battery life is not that great.. Again while recording a call it sends the other party a notification that I am recording a call

  ¬†The only con i can find is the camera it just decent and struggles in artificial lighting indoorsThe best part about this is charging speed it's crazy fast I'm a heavy users for gaming it's best with 870 and that fast changing in Just 15 minute it charges from 20- 70"
2546,Ashutosh,"I have wasted money ,please stay away with this OnePlus 9r/series",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Over priced junk.phone has heating issues even while running apps phone runs very hot.BATTERY drain issue,Even when you compare it's display with other brand mi mi11x or iqoo 7 ..it's display looks dull and brightness less compared to those phones.camers is poor,even iqoo 7 camera is much much better,5G only 2 bands,OnePlus is dumping mobiles in india.Overal not recomended to buy.i have wasted money in this"
2547,Anish Parekh,Absolute Beast | Just Go For It,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had a samsung phone previously and using this device feels super snappy conpared to the previous one. So, if you come from a 60 hz device you would be astonished.The RAM management and performance is outstanding as it comes with 8 gb of RAM and snapdragon 870. Some users initially were complaining about the heating issues in the device but for me its simply not there i.e. the device doesn't heat up at all (I haven't tried heavy games like BGMI and COD, but every android device gets a little warm playing these heavy games).The display is vibrant and goes very bright so no issues in using outdoors.The battery life is also very good as me being a normal user and not a heavy user, for me the phone easily lasted for a day and a half(with 120hz refresh rate). But, this comes with a 65 watt warp charger so it could charge the phone within 30 minutes.The indisplay fingerprint scanner is very responsive and very accurate.I do not click pictures or videos very often and so I haven't shot any proper pictures or videos so that I can judge the cameras but as I saw on some review videos the cameras are decent.The stereo speakers are best in class, super loud and clear and so they compensate for the headphone jack that isn't provided in this device.If you are purchasing this phone ONLY for camera purposes then you can look for other options in this price segment. But, overall nothing beats this.You may find devices priced lower than this and providing very similar specs but trust me, the experience that you get with oneplus isworth those extra rupees and buying this you won't regret for the extra amount paid.Final Verdict : Go for it!"
2548,Hemanth,I Love üòò it --- 1+ 9r,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love the mobile. My first one plus mobile i dont feel any heating issues why all people review like that every mobile will heat because it is working hard.

2576,Arjun B.,Awesome phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros.1. Smoothest experience ever. 120hz is buttery smooth.2. Great speakers. The dolby atmos is superb.3. The haptic feedback is excellent comparable to that of an iPhone.4. The UI experience is really great along with the 870 chip.5. The display is fab. I can now see 4k videos on youtube.6. The battery life is more than enough for me which is 10-12 hrs.7. The charging speed is great. Takes just 40 mins to charge from 15 to 100% which is so cool.Cons.1. Initial heating which can be taken care of by clearing the cache on the phone. It might also be taken care of in the future software updates.2. Good but not the greatest camera.
2577,asim,Performance and charging,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In simple words..it is the beastüòçüòçvery smooth experience with fastest charging ability. One can easily go for it without any doubts
2578,ajithkumar,OnePlus 9r review,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After something 333mb  update there us no heating issue. Soo smooth to use , awesome for gamers, camera not that much good in macro,spr sound Dolby atoms done very well.Only one question ‚ùìI dont know why they giving that 2 flash,i dont know how to use and is that flash are what ?@Oneplus"
2579,ojas d.,True flagship experience,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'll make the review more practical, bcoz many times people criticize or highlight those features of phone that are not practical.1. Excellent display (No complain about that)2. Very good battery life (around 8-9 hrs screen on time)Also charges around 45 min from 0-100%3. Ultra smooth experience of Oxygen OS in every aspect.Let it be app opening , multitasking,no lag between app switching, no pre installed apps that may steal ur data. In short very clean and smooth experience as expected.4. It has SD 870. As we all know it is much more stable than 888. And many were saying about heating issue , I didn't faced heating once also. So very stable and fast processor . Played some of games like COD, ASPHALT in highest setting. Very smooth experience. No frame drops.5. CameraCamera is little bit downside when compared to its competitors.But trust me it will not depress you.Camera captures good pics.In daylight it is great, at night it is average.So yes this is one downside if compared to other devices.But it is not deal-breaker.These are the things we use practically the most and it affects our experience.Overall a true flagship."

  ¬†It's a good phone with everything perfectly fine u can't complain about anything and the software updates they are push removes most of the problem of heating.every processer with performance is power hungry chip you will feel draining of battery but it's not much of a issue 65w charger holds it tight.u can a simple choose it because of oxygen os it's best"

2591,Amit Banerjee,"If you are not an apple iphone obsessed maniac, this is your phone by default",4.0 out of 5 stars,  What's disappointing is that even on the first day of use the phone heated up which was surprising
2592,Sanjay Banerjee,Worth buying. If you are not so much addicted to camera.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Processor, refresh rate and other is really good. Except the Google dialer"
2593,Dnyaneshwar Suryawanshi,A Good buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mobile is good. But when I received it, it had some fingerprints on the screen.Battery gets charged fast but drains fast too. I have to charge it twice a day. Display is flawless. Camera is good. Mobile is fast"
2594,Sonu Hora,OnePlus has just over hyped every product.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  So far it's okay not that great. Had High hopes for this one. But it's does the job so far. Battery drain issue and phone heating issues. Hopefully will get resolved with few OTA updates. No 90 FPS GAMING FOR PUBG. Sucks big time.
2595,Ankit Katiyar,Overall awesome phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life is less than the average phone
2596,Joydeep Mondal,Not great. Choose some other version or other product. üôè,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Other than the battery nothing else is good I think you can spend few more bugs & choose some other phone which have good video and audio qualities good picture taking capabilities and blessed things what you guys are looking for from a phone. I was using oneplus 5t for last 3.5 yrs I was a happier customer while using that oneplus 5t was when it comes to this 9r I do not find it any better than 5t.üôè
2597,Akbarali Abbasali Kharodia,"Ultra smooth display, fastest charging, powerful Processor with best UI",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  - Display is best in market- Charging speed is insane and mobile temp. does not increases during charging- Processor its top notch- OS (No need to explain its superb)Earlier before latest OS updates found heating issues but resolved now.Macro camera is not upto mark, but does not matter to me."
2598,Venkateesh,Slightly improved version of OnePlus 8t,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  To be short. It's the improved version of 8T, minor upgrades.If you are in budget, buy this one! Solid performance, camera is average. I don't wanna waste 10k, 25k for a stupid camera. Im beginning to hate OnePlus! Now, they r forcing their customers to buy Pro model. Removing lots of features from base model. Used to be flagship killer! Not anymore. Compared to 9 & 9 Pro this one is really worth it! No major issues."
2599,Jaysinh,Not up to the mark,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not up to expectation !OnePlus downgrade its own brand value.
2600,MFJ,impressive package.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Oneplus 9R | 12GB 256GBMoving from Samsung galaxy s10 to oneplus 9R, I really do like the software experience. The battery backup is much better. One thing I miss is the QHD screen from samsung, it had better resolution and colours. But the 120hz display compensates for it. Camera picks up enough details, but adds a bit more contrast than what i like. I think it is a good deal for this price range."

2608,Saswat D.,The perfect OnePlus package,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus has long moved away from the ""Flagship Killer"" tag by increasing their prices to match the market. I had been using Poco F1(an actual flagship killer) for 3 years before shifting to this 10 days ago, so my expectations for value for money were pretty high. And this phone has delivered on all expectations.Starting off, the most impressive part is the battery life coupled with the charging speed. 65W Warp Charge is just crazy fast. I am a college student with a lot of time in my hands due to the lockdown, so with fairly heavy usage, it gets me through the day very easily. I am left with around 20% charge when I wake up in the morning and plug it in. Goes to 100% in about 20-25mins maximum.The 120Hz AMOLED display is super-responsive, and smooth. Always-on works great, and it works perfectly in direct sunlight. The improved haptic motor took some time getting used to. Not the best, but at this price, I am not complaining.The under-screen FP reader works very smoothly, and fast. I still don't understand why phones moved away from having a back or side-mounted reader which was even faster, but anyway. This works well. Won't work if your hands are wet, so maybe turn on face unlock as well.Cameras have always been sort of a non-essential point with OP devices. I found the camera to be decent. I am reviewing the camera based off the fact that I'm not going to use it for shooting a movie or professional photography. Most pictures I click will be for either sharing on social media, or for my memories. And for those reasons, the camera is great enough. Nightscape is sometimes not the best, but it will return great pictures is most other conditions. The ultrawide is also good enough. Selfie camera is decent for most uses. You can always install a GCam mod to improve camera performance with Pixel's image processing algorithms.OxygenOS, as always, is extremely seamless and comfortable. No qualms there whatsoever.Minor CONS:Some people have pointed out heating issues. I personally haven't felt it that prominently. Yes, the device does heat up if I play COD for 30-40mins but that is natural, bound to happen.Speakers are loud. On full volume, they're loud enough to fill a big room. I have to keep my ringer volume at the halfway mark, because it is so loud. There is some distortion at the higher levels though.The back is a bit too slippery for my taste, and makes me paranoid to think it might slip. But the TPU case (included in box) works well. I have now slapped the OnePlus Sandstone case on, so it is very comfortable."
2609,BOSS Kannan,Excellent!!!‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I personally like this phone because of its performance ...it's like a beast ...excellent phone .... Everything is good it was more than the expectation I had .... I love it !!!!
2610,abhishek kumar verma,Too many software issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone from last 2 months. No problem in hardware. Earlier there was some issue of heating but after the patch update, no issue of heating. But, there are way too many software issues-1- Gallery is very slow. It takes too much time to open and delete things.2- While on whatsapp video call, if you minimise and then expend the video call, sometimes it gets disconnect which is very frustrating.3- Sometimes, marginal hanging issues in other apps."
2611,Kapil,Once again OnePlus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Ok product by OP. Updated from OP 6t to 9r.Not a big update by OP.Pros -Nothing much.Cons - Sometimes Heating issue may hamper - But can be easily eliminated by software update.Camera is just ok.Don't go for 9 or 9r.
2612,Amazon Customer,Exceed expectations.....,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I upgraded to OP9R from OP3T.Using this phone for last 3 days. I am going to cover real-life experience. For spec and unboxing you have may reviews to refer.Phone is fast with no lag while using any apps with assuring haptic feedback.Battery lasts for a day with emails and teams call, wesite visit, whatsapp.Screen is readable in direct sunlight. 60 Hz refresh rate is also good enough.Call quality is good and speakers are loud.Camera is usable with all the features like portrait video, steady video, nightshot, pro mode, macro etc which are more that enough for me.Clean android experience with added customisation.Overall this phone exceed my experience expectations."
2613,Mahesh Kumar,Too many bugs in software not stable,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Lot of software issues are there. Can't even see IMEI number properly. One plus care is also not working. Suggest not to buy this till everything is stabilized
2614,Karthikeyan,Awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Works fine. Good option for those wanting a flagship killer with a midrange price
2615,srinivas senapathi,Good,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good,40 k segment good"
2616,RVD,Avg product. OnePlus needs to improve on camera performance and the quality,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camer clarity is very poor. You will get the better quality in 10-15k mobiles. Processor and displays are good. I got the replacement as first one had many defect. OnePlus is focusing on quantity now not the quality. My OnePlus 7t is much better than this even after 2years.
2617,Abhy,One plus 9R as expected.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Have been using one plus 5 (8gb)since last 3 years.Everything perfect for 9R, just wondering on the 12gb Ram didn't notice Speed change compare to 8gb.Rest all perfect as expected."
2618,Amazon Customer,Oxygen OS The Beast,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Still believe that one plus has a Better OS than any other phone.
2619,Prashanth,Very poor product quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The positive first great software experience and amazing display. Good battery life.The negative very poor call quality and Amazon was amazing enough to do product replacement and both devices had same issue with Sim recognition and network. I even replaced my Sim but the problem didn't go away.
2620,Chandra,Great Device,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing build quality. Much better than 9pro... In love with the device. Thanks one plus.

2624,Nikhil Choudhary,Best one for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Absolutely worth the money spent
2625,RJoseph,"A proper, value-for-money OnePlus",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Been about two weeks with this phone. I purchased the 12GB, 256GB version and got it for 37K (after exchanging my OP5T). Buttery smooth so far. No complaints at all. I am yet to put the camera through its paces but photos are not bad.The screen is beautiful. Thin bezels and 120Hz make it a joy to look at and scroll on. Android 11 has some interesting features (Canvas wallpaper, bedtime mode, etc)Extremely satisfied so far. 10K more for the OP9 makes no sense. Highly recommend this one for the 40K to 50K price range."

2640,Navaneeth Gnanasekar,Thinking of upgrading from Oneplus 7T - GO FOR 9R WITHOUT SECOND THOUGHT,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera 4.5/5Battery 5/5Built 5/5Display 5/5Audio/Speakers 5/5Ram/Memory 5/5Storage speed 5/5OS snappiness 5/59R is a huge value device compared to all available devices even worthy than 9 and 9 proHighly recommended
2641,Aditya Popat,Worth the money for sure!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So this was a very huge upgrade for me! I shifted from oneplus 5 , to 9r (12+256gb) not surprised that it delivered A1!It's been 1 week to my 9r nowIt is absolutely lovely, the haptic feedback is awesome, the camera captures beautiful pictures, the phone NEVER lags, the display is super! Macro mode in the camera is Excellent , overall it's totally worth it and  I'm very happy with the upgrade and will write the review for oneplus 13 in the future xD"
2642,Rakesh,Average Product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product feels nice in hand and the weight balance is excellent and also the case provided was really nice in the hand.stereo speakers don't sound that high and the quality is averageCall quality is average compared to my previous phone Samsung S20+.65W Warp charger is provided but it's not clear it will support USB Power Delivery and charge your mobile in about 45Minutes.Oxygen OS is not so fast compared to Samsung one UI on S20+ here no marks to Oxygen OS.The proximity sensor on this phone is garbage and the screen keeps turn during calls and causes accidental touches to mute making another person on the call unable to hear you.I really don't recommend this mobile if you got S20 or S20+ about 50K budget. If you can go with a little premium go with them and you also get great build quality, Camera, and wireless charging options"
2643,Kruti Shah,Good buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's been almost a month now I'm using this phone... It is light in weight and user-friendly..
